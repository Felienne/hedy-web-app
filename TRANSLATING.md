Translating Hedy
================

Hedy is now (partly) available in Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, Frisian, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, Portugese (Brazilian and Portugese), Spanish and Swahili but we'd love to support more languages! Text that is not yet translated will be shown in English.
