# Validate adventure files against their schema
#
# The error messages produced by pajv are pretty bad, but we will just
# say that getting an error is better than getting NO error.
#
# If we ever care enough to do something about this, we should be interpreting
# the JSON error outputs of this tool and re-interpreting them with useful
# error messages.


# For magical and mysterious reasons, on GitHub actions using 'npx pajv validate' (which
# would normally be the way to run this command), hangs. It works fine on two of my machines,
# and also in an Ubuntu Docker container, and 'npx pajv help' works as well... but
# 'npx pajv validate' just hangs. Running the 'pajv' binary directly without the use of
# 'npx' does work... so we're just going to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and do that.
