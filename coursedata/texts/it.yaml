HedyErrorMessages:
    Wrong Level: "Questo √® il codice Hedy corretto ma non al livello giusto. Hai scritto un codice per il livello {working_level} al livello {original_level}."
    Incomplete: "Ops! Hai dimenticato un pezzo di codice! Alla linea {line_number} devi mettere del codice dopo {incomplete_command}."
    Invalid: "{invalid_command} non √® un commando Hedy per il livello {level}. Intendevi {guessed_command}?"
    Invalid Space: "Ops! Hai iniziato una linea con uno spazio alla linea {line_number}. Gli spazi confondono i computer, puoi rimuoverla?"
    Parse: "Il codice che hai scritto non √® un codice Hedy valido. C'√® un errore alla linea {location[0]}, alla posizione {location[1]}. Hai scritto {character_found} ma questo non √® permesso."
    Unquoted Text: "Stai attento. Se stampi qualcosa, il testo dovrebbe iniziare e finire con virgolette. Ne hai dimenticato una da qualche parte."
    Var Undefined: "Hai provato a scrivere {name} ma non l'hai inizializzato."

    star: "una stella"
    single quotes: "un apostrofo"
    double quotes: "virgolette"
    slash: "una barra obliqua"
    No Indentation: You used too few spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is not enough. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    string: text
    Empty Program: You created an empty program. Type Hedy code in the left field and try again
    Has Blanks: Your code is incomplete. It contains blanks that you have to replace with code.
    Unquoted Equality Check: If you want to check if a variable is equal to multiple words, the words should be surrounded by quotation marks!
    Unquoted Assignment: ' From this level, you need to place texts to the right of the `is` between quotes. You forgot that for the text {text}.'
    Cyclic Var Definition: The name {variable} needs to be set before you can use it on the right-hand side of the is command
    Lonely Echo: You used an echo before an ask, or an echo without an ask. First ask for input, then echo.
    Unexpected Indentation: You used too many spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is too much. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    Too Big: Wow! Your program has an impressive {lines_of_code} lines of code! But we can only process {max_lines} lines in this level. Make your program smaller and try again.
    Invalid Argument: You cannot use the command {command} with {invalid_argument} . Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Argument Type: You cannot use {command} with {invalid_argument} because it is {invalid_type}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Type Combination: You cannot use {invalid_argument} and {invalid_argument_2} with {command} because one is {invalid_type} and the other is {invalid_type_2}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {invalid_type_2} or {invalid_argument_2} to {invalid_type}.
    Unsupported Float: Non-integer numbers are not supported yet but they will be in a few levels. For now change {value} to an integer.
    Locked Language Feature: You are using {concept}! That is awesome, but {concept} is not unlocked yet! It will be unlocked in a later level.
    Missing Command: It looks like you forgot to use a command on line {line_number}.
