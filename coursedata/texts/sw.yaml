    Wrong Level: "Ni sahihi, lakini sio jibu la kiwango hiki. Umeandika jibu la kiwango  {working_level} kwenye kiwango cha {original_level}."
    Incomplete: "Oops! Umesahau kitu! Kwenye mstari wa {line_number}, unatakiwa kuandika nyuma ya {incomplete_command}."
    Invalid: "{invalid_command} hii sio sahihi kwa kiwango cha {level}. Ulimaanisha  {guessed_command}?"
    Invalid Space: "Oops! Ulianza mstari na nafasi(ujazo) katika mstari wa {line_number}. Nafasi huchanganya kompyuta, unaweza kuiondoa?"
    Parse: "The code you entered is not valid Hedy code. Kuna makosa katika mstari wa {location[0]}, katika nafasi ya {location[1]}. Umechapisha {character_found}, lakini lakini hiyo hairuhusiwi."

    slash: "alama ya kufyeka"
    Empty Program: You created an empty program. Type Hedy code in the left field and try again
    Has Blanks: Your code is incomplete. It contains blanks that you have to replace with code.
    Lonely Echo: You used an echo before an ask, or an echo without an ask. First ask for input, then echo.
    Unsupported Float: Non-integer numbers are not supported yet but they will be in a few levels. For now change {value} to an integer.
    Missing Command: It looks like you forgot to use a command on line {line_number}.
    string: text
    Unquoted Equality Check: If you want to check if a variable is equal to multiple words, the words should be surrounded by quotation marks!
    Unquoted Assignment: ' From this level, you need to place texts to the right of the `is` between quotes. You forgot that for the text {text}.'
    Cyclic Var Definition: The name {variable} needs to be set before you can use it on the right-hand side of the is command
    Unexpected Indentation: You used too many spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is too much. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    No Indentation: You used too few spaces in line {line_number}. You used {leading_spaces} spaces, which is not enough. Start every new block with {indent_size} spaces more than the line before.
    Too Big: Wow! Your program has an impressive {lines_of_code} lines of code! But we can only process {max_lines} lines in this level. Make your program smaller and try again.
    Invalid Argument: You cannot use the command {command} with {invalid_argument} . Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Argument Type: You cannot use the command {command} with {invalid_argument} because it is {invalid_type}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {allowed_types}.
    Invalid Type Combination: You cannot use {invalid_argument} and {invalid_argument_2} in {operation} because one is {invalid_type} and the other is {invalid_type_2}. Try changing {invalid_argument} to {invalid_type_2} or {invalid_argument_2} to {invalid_type}.
    Locked Language Feature: You are using {concept}! That is awesome, but {concept} is not unlocked yet! It will be unlocked in a later level.
    ask_needs_var: "Starting in level 2, ask needs to be used with a variable and quotation marks. Example: name is ask 'What are you called?'"
