                    ## Съчини история
                    В първо ниво можеш да съчиниш история с главен герой, измислен от теб.

                    Ползвай кода отдолу за начало в историята ти с командата `ask`, която ти предлага възможност да въведеш името на главния герой,
                    ето така:

                    ```
                    ask Коя е главната героиня в твоята история?
                    ```

                    Ползвай командата `print`, за да принтираш изречението.
                    С командата `echo`, ще можеш да принтираш името на героинята в *края* на изречението.

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    ask Главната героиня в тази история е
                    print Героинята навлиза в гъстата гора.
                    echo Леко уплашена е ...
                    print Наоколо се разнасят странни звуци и шумове...
                    print Тя се опасява, че гората е омагьосана.
                    ```

                start_code: "print Твоята история започва тук"

                    ## Съчини история
                    Във второ ниво можеш да направиш историята си по-внушителна и интересна.
                    В първо ниво името на героинята ти се принтираше само в края на изречението.
                    Сега името й може да бъде принтирано на което и да е място в изречението.

                    За тази цел ти ще напишеш малко повече код. Ха!

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди

                    ```
                    name is ask Как се нарича главаната героиня?
                    print name сега навлиза в гората.
                    print Тя е малко разтревожена.
                    print Наоколо се долавят странни шумове и звуци.
                    print name се опасява че гората може би е омагьосана.
                    ```

                    ## Произволност
                    Към историята, която пишеш можеш да добавиш нещо произволно и неочаквано, примерно чудовище, животно или някаква пречка.

                    Ето как изглежда:
                    ```
                    животни is бухал, сова, броненосец, глиган, катерица
                    print Ненадейно тя дочува звук от животни at random.
                    ```

                    ## Съчини история
                    Представи си следната история - някой повтаря едни и същи думи няколко пъти или, примерно, зове за помощ.
                    В това шесто ниво можеш да програмираш такова повторение (цикъл) с командата `repeat`.

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    print 'Принцът зовеше за помощ.'
                    repeat 5 times print 'Помоооощ!'
                    print 'А, бе защо никой не ми помага?'
                    ```

                    ## Съчини история

                    В четвърто ниво ще направиш историята си дори по-цветиста и забавна!
                    Тук ще прибавиш различни възможни завършеци, за да има изненадващ край.

                    Представи си, че историята започва така:

                    1. Принцесата се разхожда в гората.
                    2. Внезапно насреща й изскача свирепо чудовище.

                    3. **щастлив край**: Тя изважда острата си сабя и чудовището се оттегля от пътя й.
                    3. **тъжен край**: Чудовището отваря голямата си паст и поглъща принцесата цяла.

                    Сега ще ползваме променливата "име" по-гъвкаво, също както в трето ниво.
                    Виж как ползваме командите `if` (ако) и `else` (тогава), за да програмираме избирането
                    на един от двата края на историята.

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    име is ask 'Как се казва принцесата, която се разхожда в гората?'
                    print 'Принцеса ' име ' се разхожда в гората.'
                    print 'Внезапно насреща й изскача чудовище.'

                    край is ask 'Какъв край искаш на историята: щастлив или тъжен?'
                    if край is щастлив print име ' изважда острата си сабя и чудовището се оттегля от пътя й.'
                    else print 'Чудовището отваря голямата си паст и поглъща ' име ' цяла.'
                    ```

                    Може би забелязваш, че във второ ниво имаме едно малко неудобство. Пробва ли да принтираш изречение, в
                    което се съдържа променливата "име"?
                    Точно това можеш да постигнеш в трето ниво като напишеш кавички в началото и края на името.

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    име is Тони
                    print 'Името на главния герой е ' име '.'
                    print име ' навлиза в гората.'
                    print име ' е малко разтревожен.'
                    животни is бухал, таралеж, броненосец, сова, глиган

                    ## Songs
                    In level 6 you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse is 99
                    repeat 99 times
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                        print verse ' bottles of beer'
                        print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                        verse is verse - 1
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    repeat _ _ print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    print 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    ## Песни
                    В песните думите много често се повтарят, например в припевите. Репетирането е базирано на броене.
                    Да вземем например детската песен 'Десет зелени шишенца'. Можеш да програмираш тази песен, използвайки малко математически умения.

                    ## Примерен коде на Хеди
                    ```
                    стих is 10
                    print стих ' зелени шишенца на рафта си стоят.'
                    print стих ' зелени шишенца на рафта си стоят.'
                    print 'Не щеш ли паднало едно случайно и сега...'
                    стих is стих - 1
                    print 'само ' стих ' зелени шишенца на рафта си стоят.'
                    ```

                    Сега можеш да повтаряш в цикъл редовете между 2 и 9 колкото си искаш като ги копираш.

                    ## Хайде да рисуваме
                    В първо ниво ще нарисуваме нещо просто с линии и извивки. Примерно с линии и ъгли чертаем правоъгълник или стълбище.

                    Командата `forward` значи "напред" и служи за рисуване на права линия. А, `forward 50` озачава
                    "нарисувай черта с дължина 50 пиксела" (пиксел е мерна единица на екрана).

                    С командата `turn right` (завий надясно) правиш завой от 90 градуса по посока на часовниковата стрелка, а
                    командата `turn left` (завий наляво) правиш завой наляво - обратно на часовниковата стрелка.

                    Да програмираме стъпала! Можеш ли да "нарисуваш" 5 стъпала?

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    forward 50

                    turn left
                    forward 30
                    turn right
                    ```

                    В първо ниво нашата костенурка можеше да се движи само само в посока ляво или дясно. Това бързо доскучава, нали?
                    Във второ ниво ще програмираме тя да насочва носа си във всички посоки.

                    Ползвай 90 градуса, за да завиеш 1/4 (една четвърт). Едно пълно завъртане е равно на 360 градуса.
                    Представи си как би могла да "нарисуваш" фигура от свързани линии с програмиране? Може би триъгълник? Кръг?

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди

                    forward 50
                    ```

                    ## В търсене на костенурка
                    Докато рисуваш костенурката можеш да добавиш и командата `random`. С нея костенурката ще поеме в произволна посока всеки път.
                    Ползвай `at random` в комбинация с променлива с повече стойности, не само една.
                    Ползвай примера отдолу и увеличи листа с още стойности, освен 10, 50, 90, 150, 250.

                    ## Рисуваме
                    В това ниво 5 можеш да правиш изчисления, с които да рисуваш различни геометрични фигури.
                    Вероятно знаеш от училище, че да начертаеш пълна окръжност ти трябва завъртане от 360 градуса.
                    А, за да начертаеш квадрат са ти нужни 90 градуса завъртане (защото 360 / 4 = 90).
                    С Хеди можем да ползваме математика, за да начертаем каквато и да е фигура!

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    ъгли is ask 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle is 360 / ъгли
                    forward 50
                    turn angle

#
#                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.
#
#                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.

#
#                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.

#                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in level 5, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.
#
#                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
#
#                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:
#
#                    ## Example Hedy code
#                    ```
#                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
#                    points is 0
#                    throw is choices at random
#                    print 'you threw' throw
#                    if throw is earthworm points is points + 5 else points is points + throw
#                    print 'those are' points ' point'
#                    ```
#                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.
#
#                    ## Looking forward
#
#                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

#                    In level 2 we can enter lists and choose things from them.
#
#                    You first make a list with `is`. Then you can let the computer choose something from the list with `at random`.
#
#                    For example, you can let the computer pick from rock, paper and scissors.
#
#                    ## Example Hedy code

#                    ```
#
#                    You can use the `ask` again in level 2. Can you print your choice and the choice from the computer?
#                    Beware though, `ask` now works differently than in level 1. There must be a name in front of it.
#
#                    ## Looking forward
#                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices? E.g.
#
#                    ```print I chose from the choices```
#
#                    Give it a try if you haven't already. That is not working properly! You will get: I chose from the [rock, paper, scissors]. You can solve that in level 3.

#                    In level 4 we can determine who won.
#                    For that you need the new `if` code.
#
#                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
#                    Then you can use `if` to see if they are the same or different.
#                    Will you finish the code?

#                    In level 1 you can make your own virtual restaurant and take your guests' orders.
#
#                   ## Example Hedy code
#                     ```
#                    print Welcome to Hedy's restaurant
#                    ask What would you like to order?
#                    echo So you would like to order...
#                    print Thanks you for your order!
#                    print It's on its way!
#                    ```
#
#                   ## Challenge
#                   Can you think of more lines to add to your restaurant code? For example, can you ask the guests what they'd like to drink, tell them the price, or wish them a pleasant meal?

#                   ## Restaurant
#                   In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only echo the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
#                   Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!
#
#                   ## Example Hedy Restaurant
#                   ```
#                   print Welcome to Hedy's restaurant!
#                   print Today we're serving pizza or lasagna.
#                   food is ask What would you like to eat?
#                   print Great choice! The food is my favorite!
#                   topping is ask Would you like meat or veggies on that?
#                   print food with topping is on its way!
#                   drinks is ask What would you like to drink with that?
#                   print Thank you for your order.
#                   print Your food and drinks will be right there!
#                   ```
#
#                   ## Random Restaurant
#                   Having trouble to decide what you wanna have for dinner? You can let Hedy choose for you!
#                   Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
#                   You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

#                       In level 3 you have to use quotation marks when using the `print` command.
#                       Can you make your level 2 code work in level 3 by adding the quotation marks?
#
#                       Be careful! In level 2 apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in level 3 Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
#                       So instead of typing  `print Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `print 'Today we are serving pizza'`
#
#                       ## Example Hedy Restaurant

#                       In level 4 the if command allows you to ask your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
#                       In the example below, you see that you can ask the customer if they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.

#                      ## Restaurant
#                      In level 5 you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.
#
#                      ## Example Hedy Code (Simple)
#                      You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
#                      ```
#                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
#                      print 'Here is our menu:'
#                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
#                      main is ask 'Which main course would you like?'
#                      price is 0
#                      if main is pizza price is 10
#                      if main is lasagne price is 12
#                      if main is spaghetti price is 8
#                      print 'You have ordered ' main
#                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
#                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
#                      ```
#                      But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.
#
#                      ## Example Hedy Code (Elaborate)
#                      In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.
#                      ```
#                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
#                      print 'Here is our menu:'
#                      print 'Our starters are salad, soup, or carpaccio'
#                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
#                      print 'Our desserts are brownie, icecream, or milkshake'
#                      starter is ask 'Which starter would you like to have?'
#                      main is ask 'Which main course would you like?'
#                      dessert is ask 'Which dessert do you pick?'
#                      price is 0
#                      if starter is soup price is price + 6 else price is price + 7
#                      if main is pizza price is price + 10
#                      if main is lasagne price is price + 12
#                      if main is spaghetti price is price + 8
#                      if dessert is brownie price is price + 7
#                      if dessert is icecream price is price + 5
#                      if dessert is milkshake price is price + 4
#                      print 'You have ordered ' starter ' , ' main ' and ' dessert
#                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
#                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
#                      ```
#                      ## Challenge
#                      You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
#                      - ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
#                      - add another course?
#                      - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
#                      - add a children's menu?
#                      - think of other fun things to add?

#                    In level 5 you've learned how to use the repeat command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
#                    You can use that in your restaurant to ask multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:
#
#                    ```
#                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
#                    people is ask 'How many people are joining us today?'

#                    print 'Thanks for your order! Its coming right up!'
#                    ```
#                    In level 5 you can ask multiple people what they'd like to eat, but you can't print each order individually, because you can only repeat one line of code.
#                    In level 7 you'll learn how to repeat multiple lines of code at once, which allows you to ask multiple orders and print them too!

#                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
#                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!
#
#                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
#                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her echo the players' answers.
#                    Like this:
#
#                    ## Example Hedy code
#                    ```
#                    print Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
#                    ask Who are you?

#                    print I see... I see...
#                    echo Your name is...
#                    ```
#
#                    ## Challenge
#                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
#
#                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
#                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

#                    In level 2 you can use a variable and the `at random` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
#
#                    ## Example Hedy Code
#                    In this example the player can ask Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
#                    ```
#                    print I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
#                    question is ask What do you want to know?
#                    print This is what you want to know: question
#                    answers is yes, no, maybe
#                    print My crystal ball says... answers at random
#                    ```
#
#                    ## Challenges
#                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

#                    ## Fortune Teller
#                    Level 3 has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
#                    You can remake your level 2 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!
#
#                    Mind that in level 2, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
#                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!
#
#                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
#                    Make sure to remove those apostophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.
#
#                    ## Example Hedy Code
#                    ```
#                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
#                    question is ask 'What do you want to know?'
#                    print 'This is your question: ' question

#                    ## Fortune Teller
#                    In Level 4 you'll learn to (secretly) tip the odds in your favor, when using the fortune teller!
#                    By using `if` and `else` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
#                    Check out this example to find out how.
#
#                    ## Example Hedy Code
#                    ```
#                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
#                    print 'I can predict if youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
#                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
#                    if person is Hedy print 'You will definitely win!' else print 'Bad luck! Someone else will win!'
#                    ```
#
#                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
#                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers everytime you run the code.
#                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.
#
#                    ## Example Hedy Code 2
#                    ```
#                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
#                    print 'I can predict if you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
#                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
#                    goodanswer is Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
#                    badanswer is Bad luck! Try again!, Aother person will win, You lose!
#                    if person is Hedy print goodanswer at random else print badanswer at random
#                    ```
#
#                    ## Challenges
#                    This concept can be used to make may different programs, just be creative! For example you could create a machine that predicts that your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
#                    Or you could make  Snow White's magic mirror on the wall, to tell everyone you are the fairest of them all!
#                    Let your imagination do the work!

#                   ## Fortune Teller
#                   In level 5 you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
#                   For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.
#
#                   ## Example Hedy Code
#                   ```
#                   print 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
#                   print 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
#                   age is ask 'How old are you?'
#                   siblings is ask 'How many siblings do you have?'
#                   length is ask 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
#                   kids is length / age
#                   kids is kids - siblings
#                   print 'You will get ...'
#                   print kids ' kids!'
#                   ```
#
#                   ## Example Silly Fortune Teller
#                   If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!
#
#                   ```
#                   print 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
#                   print 'I will predict how smart you are!'
#                   football is ask 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
#                   bananas is ask 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
#                   hygiene is ask 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
#                   result is bananas + hygiene
#                   result is result * football
#                   print 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'

#                   ## Fortune Teller
#                   In level 6 you can use the `repeat` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
#
#                   ## Example Hedy Code
#                   ```
#                   print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
#                   print 'You can ask 3 questions!'
#                   repeat 3 times question is ask 'What do you want to know?'
#                   answer is yes, no, maybe
#                   repeat 3 times print 'My crystall ball says... ' answer at random
#                   ```
#
#                   ## Challenge
#                   As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
#                   Everytime the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
#                   This means you can't print all the questions this way.
#
#                   By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
#                   This does mean that you can only use `repeat` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions seperately.
#                   Can you do it?
#
#                   In level 7 the layout of repeat command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

#                 In level 5 you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
#                 In level 7 that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.

#                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
#                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but if not a terrible monster might...
#
#                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and ask the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.
#
#                    ## Example Hedy code
#
#                    ```
#                    print How did i get here?
#                    print I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
#                    print and suddenly everything went black.
#                    print But how did I end up on the floor...?
#                    print My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
#                    print What's that sound?
#                    print Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
#                    print I need to get out of here!
#                    print There are 3 doors in front of me..
#                    ask Which door should i pick?

#                    In level 1 you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
#                    In level 2 you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
#                    Let Hedy decide randomly!
#
#                    ## Example Hedy Code

#                    print There are 3 doors in front of you...
#                    choice is ask Which door do you choose?
#                    print You picked door ... choice
#                    monsters is a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED

#                    ## Challenge
#                    This story is pretty straight forward, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
#                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

#                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
#                    In the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
#                    In level 4 you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

#                    ## What's next?
#                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover.
#
#                    In the first level you might've notice that the `echo` command can only save one bit of information at a time.
#                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence.
#
#                    ```
#                    print Welcome at Hedy's
#                    ask What would you like to eat?
#                    echo So you want...
#                    ask what would you like to drink?
#                    echo So you want...
#                    ```
#                    If the player types a hamburger and coke, you can't say `so you woudl like a hamburger and coke`, but you have to make two seperate line.
#                    Also, the `echo` command only echoes the word at the end of the sentence. So you can't say `your hamburger is coming right up!`.
#
#                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
#                    Besides, you'll learn how to work with the `at random` command, that you can use to make games.
#                    So let's go to the next level!
#
#                start_code: "print Let's go!"

#                    ## What's next?
#                    In level 2 you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.
#
#                    Try to run this code:
#                    ```
#                    name is Sophie
#                    print My name is name
#                    ```
#                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`.
#                    In level 3 this problem is fixed by using quotation marks.
#
#                start_code: "print Let's go to the next level!"
#            3:
#                story_text: |
#                    ## What's next?
#                    In level 2 and 3 you've already learned to use `at random` which made your games different every time you ran the code.
#                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game.
#
#                    In level 4 you'll learn the `if` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example.
#                    So let's take a peak at level 4.
#                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"
#            4:
#                story_text: |
#                    ## What's next?
#                    Now you've reached the end of level 4, so you have learned `ask` and `if`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
#                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.
#
#                    Level 5 makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
#                    Another option in level 6 is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
#                    Go see for yourself in the next level!
#
#                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"
#            5:
#                story_text: |
#                   ## What's next?
#                    Great job! You've reached the end of level 5, which means you have practiced with `if` and `else`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
#                    For example if you want to program 'Happy Birthday'
#
#                    ```
#                    print 'happy birthday to you'
#                    print 'happy birthday to you'
#                    print 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
#                    print 'happy birthday to you'
#
#                    ```
#                    That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily level 6 has a solution with the `repeat` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.
#
#
#                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"
#            6:
#                story_text: |
#                    ## What's next?
#                    In level 6 you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
#                    Level 7 allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!
#
#                    ```
#                    repeat 5 times print 'In level 7 you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
#                    ```
#
#                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

#                story_text: |
#                    ## What's next?
#                    You have reached the end of level 7, you're doing great! You are about to go to level 8. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python.
#                    In Python there is no `repeat` command, but there is a command that works like repeat. Are you curious to find out how to say `repeat` in "real" programming language? Quickly go to level 8 to find out!
#                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"
#            8:
#                story_text: |
#                    ## What's next?
#                    Your code is looking more and more like a python code, great! In level 9 you will learn another small step to make it even more like python.
#                    Another great thing you'll learn in level 9 is a new command. In level 8, you might have noticed that you sometimes could use another `else` in your code.
#                    For example:
#                    ```
#                    print 'What is for dinner tonight?'
#                    options is pizza, broccoli, green beans
#                    chosen is options at random
#                    if options is pizza
#                        print 'Yummy! Pizza!'
#                    else
#                        print 'Yikes...'
#                    ```
#                    In this code it would be great to have 2x an `else` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. Level 9 comes with the new command `elif` that makes this possible!
#                    So check out the next level now!
#                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## Кой мие чиниите?
                    Кой член от семейството мие най-често чиниите вкъщи? И справедливо ли е това?

                    ## Примерен код на Хеди
                    ```
                    семейство is мама, тате, Лили, Сашо
                    лили_пъти is 0
                    мияч is семейство at random
                    print 'Миячът е ' мияч '.'
                    if мияч is Лили лили_пъти is лили_пъти + 1
                    print '----'
                    print 'Лили ще измие чиниите тази седмица ' лили_пъти ' пъти.'
                    ```

                    Ако сега копираш и добавиш програмния код от 3-ти до 5-ти ред, тоест 7 пъти за цяла седмица,
                    програмата ще изчисли колко пъти общо Лили ще мие чинии тази седмижца.

                start_code: "print 'Кой мие чиниите?'"

                    С командата `if` ще създадем възможност за повече избор в програмата ни.
                    Можеш да програмираш реакция на системата по определен избор.

                    Можеш ли да довършиш примерния код по-долу с думите 'Какъв лош късмет..' когато ти си наред да миеш?
                    И не забравяй да ползваш кавички около текста!

                    if мияч is Сашо print _ Какъв лош късмет да ми се падне да мия чиниите _
                    else print 'Ах, супер, не трабва да мия аз чиниите, защото ' _ ' вече ги мие!'
                    ```

                    ## Кой мие чиниите?

                    Сега ползвай кавички, за да подобриш графика на миячите на чинии.
                    Този път в кода има пропуски, отбелязани с черта за подчертаване '_'.

                    Можеш ли да замениш 'празните места' с подходящ код - дума или символ?

                    Съвет: не забравяй да ползваш кавички около текста!
