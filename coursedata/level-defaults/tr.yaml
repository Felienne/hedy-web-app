    commands:
    -   name: '{and}'
        explanation: Two parts both need to be correct
        example: if 3+2 {is} 5 {and} 2+2 {is} 4
        demo_code: "answer1 = {ask} 'What is 3+2?'\nanswer2 = {ask} 'What is 2+2?'\n{if} answer1 {is} 5 {and} answer2 {is} 4\n    {print} 'Both answers are correct!'\nelse\n    {print} 'At least one answer is wrong!'"
    -   name: '{or}'
        explanation: At least 1 of the two parts need to be correct. If both are correct, it is also fine.
        example: if 3+2 {is} 5 {or} 2+2 {is} 4
        demo_code: "answer1 = {ask} 'What is 3+2?'\nanswer2 = {ask} 'What is 2+2?'\n{if} answer1 {is} 5 {or} answer2 {is} 4\n    {print} 'At least one answer is correct!'\nelse\n    {print} 'Both answers are wrong!'"

    intro_text: We are now going to learn `{and}` and `{or}`! If you want to check two statements, you don't have to use two if's but can use `{and}` and `{or}`. If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.
    example_code: "```\nname = ask 'what is your name?'\nage = ask 'what is your age?'\nif name is 'Hedy' and age is 2\n    print 'You are the real Hedy!'\n```\n"

    commands:
    -   name: Smaller
        explanation: We use the `<` to check if the first number is smaller than the second number.
        example: 'For example: age < 12'
        demo_code: "age = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age < 13\n    {print} 'You are younger than me!'"
    -   name: Bigger
        explanation: We use the `>` to check if the first number is bigger than the second number.
        example: 'For example: age > 12'
        demo_code: "age = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age > 13\n    {print} 'You are older than me!'"
    -   name: Equal
        explanation: We use the `==` to check if two things are the same.
        example: 'For example: answer == 25'
        demo_code: "answer = {ask} 'What is 5 * 5?'\n{if} answer == 25\n    {print} 'That {is} correct!'"
    -   name: Not equal
        explanation: 'We use the `!=` to check if two things are not the same. '
        example: 'For example: answer != 25'
        demo_code: "answer = {ask} 'What is 5 * 5?'\n{if} answer != 25\n    {print} 'That is not correct!'"
    -   name: Smaller {or} equal
        explanation: We use the `<=` to check if the first number is smaller than or equal to the second number.
        example: 'For example: age <= 12'
        demo_code: "age = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age <= 12\n    {print} 'You are younger than me!'"
    -   name: Bigger or equal
        explanation: We use the `>=` to check if the first number is bigger than or equal to the second number.
        example: 'For example: age >= 14'
        demo_code: "age = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age >= 14\n    {print} 'You are older than me!'"
    start_code: "age = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age < 13\n    {print} 'You are younger than me!'\nelse\n    {print} 'You are older than me!'"
    intro_text: "We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.\nThe `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example `age < 12` checks if `age` {is} smaller than 12.\nIf you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example `age <= 11`.\nThe `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example `points > 10` checks if `points` is larger than 10.\nIf you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example `points >= 11`.\nYou use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:\n```\nage = {ask} 'How old are you?'\n{if} age > 12\n    {print} 'You are older than I am!'\n```\n\nFrom this level on, if you want to compare exactly, you can use two equal signs. This is what most programming languages do:\n```\nname = {ask} 'What is your name?'\n{if} name == 'Hedy'\n    {print} 'You are coo!'\n```\n\nYou can also compare if something is *not* equal to something else using `!=` like this:\n```\nname = {ask} 'What is your name?'\n{if} name != 'Hedy'\n    {print} 'You are not Hedy'\n```\n"

We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.\nSo don't forget to change the value in the loop.\n\nIn the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.\nIf the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!\n"
    commands:
    -   name: '{while}'
        explanation: We can use the `{while}` loop with not equal
        example: 'Example: {while} correct_answer != 25'
        demo_code: "answer = 0\n{while} answer != 25\n    answer = {ask} 'What is 5 times 5?'\n{print} 'A correct answer has been given'"
    -   name: Smaller {while}
        explanation: 'We can also use the `{while}` loop with `<` and `>`. '
        example: 'For example: {while} count < 3'
        demo_code: "count = 1\n{while} count < 3\n    {print} 'We do this ' 3 - count ' more times'\n    count = count + 1\n{print} 'We are done'"

    intro_text: "We are going to make lists the Python way, with square brackets around the lists! We also keep the quotation marks around each item like we have learned in previous levels.\nYou can use the square brackets as well to point out a place in the lists.\n\n```\nfriends = ['Ahmed', 'Ben', 'Cayden']\nlucky_numbers = [15, 18, 6]\n{for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 3\n    {print} 'the lucky number of ' friends[i]\n    {print} 'is ' lucky_numbers[i]\n```\n"
    commands:
    -   name: square brackets
        explanation: Lists with square brackets
        example: "For example: fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']"
        demo_code: "fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n{print} fruit"
    -   name: Get an item from a list
        explanation: To get an item from a list we use [number] so fruit[1] means, get the first fruit from the list!
        example: 'For example: firstfruit = fruit[1]'
        demo_code: "fruit = ['banana', 'apple', 'cherry']\nfirstfruit = fruit[1]\n{print} firstfruit"
    -   name: Get a random item from a list
        explanation: To get a random item from a list we use [random] so fruit[random] means, get a random fruit from the list!
        example: 'For example: random_fruit {is} fruit[random]'
        demo_code: "fruit = ['banana', 'apple', 'cherry']\nrandom_fruit = fruit[random]\n{print} random_fruit"

    -   name: '{print}'
        explanation: When we use a `{for}`, we need to put a `:` behind the `{for}` statement!
        example: 'for i {in} {range} 1 {to} 10:'
        demo_code: "{for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 12:\n    {print} i\n{print} 'Ready or not, here I come!'"
    -   name: '{if}'
        explanation: We need to do the same with all of our `{if}` statements
        example: if colour {is} green:'
        demo_code: "colour = {ask} 'What is your favorite color?'\n{if} colour == 'green':\n    {print} 'Your favorite colour is green'\n{else}:\n    {print} 'Your favorite colour is not green'"

Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.\n\nIn this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for {else} {if} and you need it when you you want to make 3 (or more!) options.\nCheck it out!\n```\nprices = ['1 million dollars', 'an apple pie', 'nothing']\nyour_price = prices[random]\n{print} 'You win ' your_price\n{if} your_price == '1 million dollars' :\n    {print} 'Yeah!

    commands:

        explanation: With `{print}` you need to use parentheses
        example: '{print}'
