Level 5 introduces a new command, `repeat`.

Here youâ€™ll find a couple of exercises to do in level 5.

# Multiple dice!

Level 5 allows you to recreate the dice again, but now you can throw multiple dice at once! Like this:

* `choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm`
* `repeat 5 times print 'you have thrown ' choices at random`

Of course you can also make different dice from different games.

# Who has to do the dishes?

You can let Hedy decide who is doing the dishes for every day of the week. For instance:

* `people is mum, dad, Emma, Sophie`
* `repeat 7 times print 'the person doing is dishes is...' people at random`

# Sing a song!

Songs very often contain a lot of repetition. For example Baby shark! They sing the same lyrics the whole time:

* `print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'`
* `print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'`
* `print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'`
* `print 'Baby Shark'`

You can easily shorten your code like this:
* `repeat 3 times print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'`
* `print 'Baby Shark'`
