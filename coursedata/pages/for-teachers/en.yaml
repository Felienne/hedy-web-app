          text: |
            Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).
            In contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.
            So with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.
            This way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!
            Here you can watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) about the development of Hedy as a programming language.
        - title: "Target audience"
          text: |
            Hedy's developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).
            It's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.
            Students (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.

        - title: "Teaching with Hedy"
          text: |
            Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands.
            The exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.
            The lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too!
            Of course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises!
        - title: "Devices"
          text: |
            Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, FireFox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.
            0There's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!
