                    ## Make a story
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    As the first line, use this code:

                    ```
                    ask who is the star in your story?
                    ```

                    After that first line, start with `print` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `echo` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    ask The main character of this story is
                    print The main character is now going to walk in the forest
                    echo He's a bit scared,
                    print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    print He's afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                start_code: "print Your story starts here"
            2:

                    ## Story
                    In level 2 you can make your story more fun. Your main character's name can now be anywhere in the sentence.

                    You do have to program a little bit extra for that. You must now name your main character first.

                    You can then put that name anywhere in a sentence.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    name is ask What is the name of the main character?
                    print name is now going to run in the woods
                    print name is a bit scared
                    print He hears crazy noises everywhere
                    print name is afraid this is a haunted forest
                    ```

                    ## Randomness
                    You can also add something random to your story. Any monster, animal or other obstacle.

                    It goes like this:
                    ```
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print He now hears the sound of an animals at random
                    ```
                start_code: "print Your story"
            3:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story
                    You may have noticed that there is still a problem in level 2. Did you try to print a sentence that contained the word name?
                    You can solve that in level 3. You must use quotation marks for everything that you are going to print.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is Hans
                    print 'The name of the main character is' name
                    print name 'is now going to walk in the woods'
                    print name 'is a bit scared'
                    animals is owl, hedgehog, armadillo
                    print 'He hears the sound of an' animals at random
                    print name 'is afraid this is a haunted forest'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Your story will be printed here!'"
            4:

                    ## Story
                    What you can do in level 4 is make your story even more fun. In level 4 you can program different endings.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in level 3. You can combine that with an `if`, and then you have already made a whole program!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    name is ask Who is walking in the forest?
                    print name 'walks through the forest'
                    print name 'encounter a monster'
                    end is ask Would you like a good or a bad ending?
                    if end is good print name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    else print 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Here your story will start!'"
            6:
                story_text: |
                    ## Story
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in level 6 with `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'The prince kept calling for help'
                    repeat 5 times print 'Help!'
                    print 'Why is nobody helping me?'
                    ```

                start_code: "repeat 5 times print 'Help!'"
    songs:

                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse is 99
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    print verse ' bottles of beer'
                    print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse is verse - 1
                    print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                start_code: "print 'Baby shark'"
            6:
                story_text: |
                    ## Songs
                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `repeat`! Can you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    repeat _ _ print 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    print 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.
                start_code: "print 'Baby Shark'"
            7:
                story_text: |
                    ## Songs
                    In level 6 you've programmed the song 'Bottles of beer'. You made one verse and then had to copy the verses 99 times. In level 7 you can repeat the song 99 times, just by adding one simple line!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    verse is 99
                    repeat 99 times
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                        print verse ' bottles of beer'
                        print 'Take one down, pass it around'
                        verse is verse - 1
                        print verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 1 you can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or a stair!

                    Using `forward` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `turn right` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `turn left` turns counter clockwise.

                    This is the start of some little stairs. Can you make it to 5 steps?

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    forward 50
                    turn left
                    forward 50
                    turn right
                    ```


                start_code: "forward 50\nturn left"
            2:
                story_text: |
                    In level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
                    Can you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    print Drawing figures
                    angle is 90
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    ```

                    ## Searching turtle
                    You can also use `random` with the drawing turtle. A random choice makes the turtle walk a different path each time. 
                    Use `at random` to choose a value from a list. You can copy and paste lines 2 and 3 so create a longer random path.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    angles is 10, 50, 90, 150, 250
                    turn angles at random
                    forward 25
                    ```

                start_code: |
                    print Turtle race!
                    hoek is 90
                    turn hoek
                    forward 25

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 3 you have to use quotation marks with `print` and `ask`. Also when drawing!
                    
                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 4 you can make a choice with `if`. For example between different types of figures.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Drawing Figures'

                    if figure is triangle angle is 120 else angle is 90
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle
                    forward 25
                    turn angle

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 5 you can use calculations to draw different figures.
                    You may have learned in school that turning a full circle is 360 degrees. If not, now you know!
                    That's why you also use 90 degrees for a square. 360 divided by 4 is 90.
                    Now that we can do math with Hedy, we can draw all the figures we want!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angles is ask 'How many angles do you want?'
                    angle is 360 / angles
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    forward 50
                    turn angle
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    print 'Drawing figures'

                    ## Let's draw
                    In level 6 you can repeat one line of code with `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print 'Draw figures'
                    repeat 3 times forward 10
                    ```
                start_code: |
                    print 'Draw figures'
                    repeat 3 times forward 10

            7:
                story_text: |
                    ## Let's draw
                    Now that we can repeat several lines, we can make figures more easily.
                    We only have to set the angle once and then use that variable in the `repeat`.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angle is 90
                    repeat 10 times
                        turn angle
                        forward 50
                    ```

                    ## Interaction
                    Also, we can now improve the program that draws different figures.
                    Can you figure out how far the turtle has to turn here? Finish the code and you can draw any polygon you'd like!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    angles is ask 'How many angles should I draw?'
                    angle is 360 / angles
                    repeat angle times
                        turn __

                    ## Dishwashing
                    Do you always disagree at home about who should wash the dishes or change the litter box today?

                    Then you can let the computer choose very fairly. You can program that in level 2!

                    You first make a list of the members of your family. Then choose 'at random' from the list.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    print people at random
                    ```

                    With quotation marks you can make your dishwashing planning more beautiful.
                    This time the sample code is not quite complete.

                    Can you complete the code by filling the blanks? Every blank must be replaced with one word of symbol.

                    Tip: Don't forget the quotation marks!
                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ## Dishwashing
                    With the `if` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    dishwasher is people at random
                    if dishwasher is Sophie print _ too bad I have to do the dishes _ else print 'luckily no dishes because' _ 'is already washing up'
                    ```
                start_code: "print 'Who does the dishes?'"

                    ## Dishwashing
                    How often is everyone going to do the dishes? Is that fair? You can count that in level 6.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    people is mom, dad, Emma, Sophie
                    emma_washes is 0
                    dishwasher is people at random
                    print 'The dishwasher is' dishwasher
                    if dishwasher is Emma emma_washes is emma_washes + 1
                    print 'Emma will do the dishes this week' emma_washes 'times'
                    ```

                    Now you can copy lines 3 to 5 a few times (e.g. 7 times for a whole week) to calculate for a whole week again.
                    Do you make the code for the whole week?

                    In level 2 we can choose from a list. With that we can let the computer choose one side of the die.

                    Take a look at the games you have in your closet at home.

                    Are there games with a (special) die? You can also copy it with this code.

                    For example, the dice of the game Earthworms with the numbers 1 to 5 and an earthworm on it.

                    print _ _ _ <- here you have to program the choice

                    You can also make a die again in level 4 using the `if`.
                    Complete the sample code so that the code says "You can stop throwing" once you have thrown an earthworm.

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something else.

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    throw is _
                    print 'you have' _ 'thrown'
                    if _ is earthworm print 'You can stop throwing.' _ print 'You have to hear it again!'

                    ## Dice
                    You can also make an Earthworm die again in level 5, but now you can also calculate how many points have been rolled.

                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.

                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    choices is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, earthworm
                    points is 0
                    throw is choices at random
                    print 'you threw' throw
                    if throw is earthworm points is points + 5 else points is points + throw
                    print 'those are' points ' point'
                    ```
                    Can you make the code so that you get the total score for 8 dice? To do that, you have to cut and paste some lines of the code.

                    ## Looking forward

                    Did you manage to calculate the score for 8 dice? That required a lot of cutting and pasting, right? We are going to make that easier in level 7!

                    With `ask` you can make a choice, and with `echo` you can repeat that choice.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    print what do you choose?

                    ## Rock, paper, scissors

                    In level 2 we can enter lists and choose things from them.

                    You first make a list with `is`. Then you can let the computer choose something from the list with `at random`.

                    For example, you can let the computer pick from rock, paper and scissors.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    choices is rock, paper, scissors
                    print choices at random
                    ```

                    You can use the `ask` again in level 2. Can you print your choice and the choice from the computer?
                    Beware though, `ask` now works differently than in level 1. There must be a name in front of it.

                    ## Looking forward
                    Did you happen to try to make a sentence that included the word choices? E.g.

                    ```print I chose from the choices```

                    Give it a try if you haven't already. That is not working properly! You will get: I chose from the [rock, paper, scissors]. You can solve that in level 3.

                    Do you complete the code by entering the correct commands or characters on the underscores?

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    print _ The computer chose: _ _ at _

                    In level 4 we can determine who won.
                    For that you need the new `if` code.

                    Save your choice with the name of choice and the choice of computer as computer choice.
                    Then you can use `if` to see if they are the same or different.
                    Will you finish the code?

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    print 'you chose' _
                    print 'computer chose' _
                    if _ is _ print 'tie!' else print 'no tie'
                    if choice is stone and computer choice is paper print 'computer wins'
                    ```

                    First fill in the correct code on the blanks to see if it is a draw.

                    Then copy the last line a few times and fill in all the different options correctly.

                    Now you have finished your own rock, paper, scissors! It's still a bit complicated with all those different options, isn't it?
                    We will make that a bit easier in a later level.

                    ask What would you like to order?
                    echo So you would like to order...
                    print Thanks you for your order!
                    print It's on its way!

                   ## Challenge
                   Can you think of more lines to add to your restaurant code? For example, can you ask the guests what they'd like to drink, tell them the price, or wish them a pleasant meal?

                   In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only echo the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                   Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!

                   ## Example Hedy Restaurant
                   ```
                   print Welcome to Hedy's restaurant!
                   print Today we're serving pizza or lasagna.
                   food is ask What would you like to eat?
                   print Great choice! The food is my favorite!
                   topping is ask Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                   print food with topping is on its way!
                   drinks is ask What would you like to drink with that?
                   print Thank you for your order.
                   print Your food and drinks will be right there!
                   ```

                   ## Random Restaurant
                   Having trouble to decide what you wanna have for dinner? You can let Hedy choose for you!
                   Simply add lists of your favorite (or least favorite) meals and Hedy can randomly choose your dinner.
                   You can also have a bit of fun, by letting Hedy choose the price for your dinner as well! What will you get?

                   ## Example Hedy Code Random Restaurant

                   ```

                   print The only restaurant that will randomly choose your meal and its price for you!
                   starters is salad, soup, carpaccio
                   mains is pizza, brussels sprouts, spaghetti
                   desserts is brownies, ice cream, french cheeses
                   drinks is cola, beer, water
                   prices is 1 dollar, 10 dollars, 100 dollars
                   print You will start with: starters at random
                   print Then we'll serve: mains at random
                   print And as dessert: desserts at random
                   print You will get a drinks at random to drink

                       In level 3 you have to use quotation marks when using the `print` command.
                       Can you make your level 2 code work in level 3 by adding the quotation marks?

                       Be careful! In level 2 apostrophes were allowed in the text, but in level 3 Hedy will confuse them for quotation marks and the code will not work!
                       So instead of typing  `print Today we're serving pizza` , you should type `print 'Today we are serving pizza'`

                       ## Example Hedy Restaurant

                       In level 4 the if command allows you to ask your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                       In the example below, you see that you can ask the customer if they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.

                       ## Example Hedy Code
                       ```
                       print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                       special is ask 'Would you like to hear our specials today?'

                       ## Challenge
                       Can you think of more questions to ask the customers when they are ordering, and make up different responses to their answers by using the if command?

                      ## Restaurant
                      In level 5 you can use maths to calculate the total price of your customer's order, which can make your virtual restaurant more realistic.

                      ## Example Hedy Code (Simple)
                      You can make a simple restaurant code, like this:
                      ```
                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                      print 'Here is our menu:'
                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                      main is ask 'Which main course would you like?'
                      price is 0
                      if main is pizza price is 10
                      if main is lasagne price is 12
                      if main is spaghetti price is 8
                      print 'You have ordered ' main
                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                      ```
                      But you can also add many more things to your virtual restaurant, for example more courses.

                      ## Example Hedy Code (Elaborate)
                      In this example there are three courses, which requires more code and more additions in calculating the price.
                      ```
                      print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant'
                      print 'Here is our menu:'
                      print 'Our starters are salad, soup, or carpaccio'
                      print 'Our main courses are pizza, lasagne, or spaghetti'
                      print 'Our desserts are brownie, icecream, or milkshake'
                      starter is ask 'Which starter would you like to have?'
                      main is ask 'Which main course would you like?'
                      dessert is ask 'Which dessert do you pick?'
                      price is 0
                      if starter is soup price is price + 6 else price is price + 7
                      if main is pizza price is price + 10
                      if main is lasagne price is price + 12
                      if main is spaghetti price is price + 8
                      if dessert is brownie price is price + 7
                      if dessert is icecream price is price + 5
                      if dessert is milkshake price is price + 4
                      print 'You have ordered ' starter ' , ' main ' and ' dessert
                      print 'That will be ' price ' dollars, please'
                      print 'Thank you, enjoy your meal!'
                      ```
                      ## Challenge
                      You can add many more things to your virtual restaurant. For example, can you...
                      - ask how many people are coming and multiply the price by that amount?
                      - add another course?
                      - give people a discount when they enter a (secret) couponcode?
                      - add a children's menu?
                      - think of other fun things to add?

                    In level 5 you've learned how to use the repeat command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to ask multiple people what they'd like to eat. Like this:

                    ```
                    print 'Welcome to Hedys restaurant!'
                    people is ask 'How many people are joining us today?'
                    repeat people times food is ask 'What whould you like to eat?'
                    print 'Thanks for your order! Its coming right up!'
                    ```
                    In level 5 you can ask multiple people what they'd like to eat, but you can't print each order individually, because you can only repeat one line of code.
                    In level 7 you'll learn how to repeat multiple lines of code at once, which allows you to ask multiple orders and print them too!

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her echo the players' answers.
                    Like this:

                    ## Example Hedy code
                    ```
                    print Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    ask Who are you?
                    print Let me take a look in my crystall ball
                    print I see... I see...
                    echo Your name is...
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In level 1 you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only echo.
                    In level 2 you can use a variable and the `at random` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    In this example the player can ask Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    print I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question is ask What do you want to know?
                    print This is what you want to know: question
                    answers is yes, no, maybe
                    print My crystal ball says... answers at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or 'ask again'.

                    Level 3 has no new functions, but allows you to practice with using the quotation marks.
                    You can remake your level 2 code, and make sure to add the quotation marks in the right places!

                    Mind that in level 2, we couldn't use the word 'question' as both the name of the variable and a normal word that could be printed.
                    The quotation marks in level 3 make this possible!

                    Important! Mind that now that we're using quotation marks, Hedy will get confused when you use the apostrophe for contractions like I'm or What's.
                    Make sure to remove those apostophes and change the spelling to Im or Whats.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    question is ask 'What do you want to know?'
                    print 'This is your question: ' question

                    ## Fortune Teller
                    In Level 4 you'll learn to (secretly) tip the odds in your favor, when using the fortune teller!
                    By using `if` and `else` you can make sure that you will always get a good fotune, while other people might not.
                    Check out this example to find out how.

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if youll win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
                    if person is Hedy print 'You will definitely win!' else print 'Bad luck! Someone else will win!'
                    ```

                    Replace Hedy with your own name in the last line, and Hedy will always predict that you will win the lottery and others won't!
                    Of course this might raise some suspicion with the other players... To avoid that, you can make sure that Hedy does give different answers everytime you run the code.
                    But of course, still gives you a positive answer and the other players a negative one.

                    ## Example Hedy Code 2
                    ```
                    print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    print 'I can predict if you will win the lottery tomorrow!'
                    person is ask 'Who are you?'
                    goodanswer is Hurray! You win!, You will definitely win!, We have a winner!
                    badanswer is Bad luck! Try again!, Aother person will win, You lose!
                    if person is Hedy print goodanswer at random else print badanswer at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenges
                    This concept can be used to make may different programs, just be creative! For example you could create a machine that predicts that your favorite sports team will beat all the competitors!
                    Or you could make  Snow White's magic mirror on the wall, to tell everyone you are the fairest of them all!
                    Let your imagination do the work!

                   ## Fortune Teller
                   In level 5 you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.
                   For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                   ## Example Hedy Code
                   ```
                   print 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                   print 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                   age is ask 'How old are you?'
                   siblings is ask 'How many siblings do you have?'
                   length is ask 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                   kids is length / age
                   kids is kids - siblings
                   print 'You will get ...'
                   print kids ' kids!'
                   ```

                   ## Example Silly Fortune Teller
                   If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                   ```
                   print 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                   print 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                   football is ask 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                   bananas is ask 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                   hygiene is ask 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                   result is bananas + hygiene
                   result is result * football
                   print 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'
                   ```

                   ## Fortune Teller
                   In level 6 you can use the `repeat` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.

                   ## Example Hedy Code
                   ```
                   print 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                   print 'You can ask 3 questions!'
                   repeat 3 times question is ask 'What do you want to know?'
                   answer is yes, no, maybe
                   repeat 3 times print 'My crystall ball says... ' answer at random
                   ```

                   ## Challenge
                   As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                   Everytime the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                   This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                   By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                   This does mean that you can only use `repeat` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions seperately.
                   Can you do it?

                   In level 7 the layout of repeat command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                 ## Fortune Teller
                 In level 5 you've learned how to use repeat to make the fortune teller answer 3 questions in a row, but we had a problem with printing the questions.
                 In level 7 that problem is solved, because of the new way of using the repeat command.
                 In the next example you can have your fortune teller ask 3 questions and also print them!

                    ## Haunted house game
                    In this adventure you are working towards making a game in which you have to escape from a haunted house by picking the correct door.
                    If you pick the right door you'll survive, but if not a terrible monster might...

                    In level 1 we start our haunted house game by making up a scary story and ask the player what monster they'll see in the haunted house.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    ```
                    print How did i get here?
                    print I remember my friend telling me to go into the old mansion...
                    print and suddenly everything went black.
                    print But how did I end up on the floor...?
                    print My head hurts like Ive been hit by a baseball bat!
                    print What's that sound?
                    print Oh no! I feel like Im not alone in this house!
                    print I need to get out of here!
                    print There are 3 doors in front of me..
                    ask Which door should i pick?
                    echo I choose door...
                    print ...?
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    Can you finish the scary story? Or make up your own haunted house story?

                    ## Haunted house game
                    In level 1 you've made an introduction to your haunted house game, but as you might have noticed the story would always have a dreadful end.
                    In level 2 you can make your story more interactive by changing the outcome of the game; sometimes you'll get eaten, sometimes you'll escape!
                    Let Hedy decide randomly!

                    ## Example Hedy Code
                    ```
                    print Escape from the haunted house!
                    print There are 3 doors in front of you...
                    choice is ask Which door do you choose?
                    print You picked door ... choice
                    monsters is a zombie, a vampire, NOTHING YOUVE ESCAPED
                    print You see...
                    print monsters at random
                    ```

                    ## Challenge
                    This story is pretty straight forward, maybe you can spook it up a bit by adding a more exciting story.
                    Also you have very limited outcomes right now, there are only 3 options of what's behind the doors. Maybe you can think of more monsters to add to the list!

                    ## Change the game into a tv gameshow!
                    Lastly, we'd like to challenge you to change this game into a gameshow (like the ones on tv) where you choose a door or suitcase and it contains a big price!
                    Can you do it?

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    In the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In level 4 you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    ## Example Hedy code

                    print 'Escape from the haunted house!'

                    monsters is werewolf, mummy, vampire, zombie

                    ## What's next?
                    Congratulations! You've reached the end of level 1. Hopefully you've already made some awesome codes, but Hedy has a lot more to discover. 
                    
                    In the first level you might've notice that the `echo` command can only save one bit of information at a time. 
                    For example in the restaurant adventure, you could echo what the costumer wanted to eat, or what they wanted to drink, but not both in one sentence. 
                    
                    ```
                    print Welcome at Hedy's
                    ask What would you like to eat?
                    echo So you want...
                    ask what would you like to drink?
                    echo So you want...
                    ```
                    If the player types a hamburger and coke, you can't say `so you woudl like a hamburger and coke`, but you have to make two seperate line. 
                    Also, the `echo` command only echoes the word at the end of the sentence. So you can't say `your hamburger is coming right up!`.
                    
                    That changes in level 2. In level 2 you'll learn to work with variables, that allow you to save multiple pieces of information and print them in any place you want.
                    Besides, you'll learn how to work with the `at random` command, that you can use to make games. 
                    So let's go to the next level!
                    
                start_code: "print Let's go!"
            2:
                story_text: |
                    ## What's next?
                    In level 2 you've been practising with variables, but maybe you've come across this mistake.
                    
                    Try to run this code:
                    ```
                    name is Sophie
                    print My name is name
                    ```
                    Of course you wanted to print `My name is Sophie` but Hedy prints `My Sophie is Sophie`. 
                    In level 3 this problem is fixed by using quotation marks. 
                    
                start_code: "print Let's go to the next level!"

                    ## What's next?
                    In level 2 and 3 you've already learned to use `at random` which made your games different every time you ran the code. 
                    But it's not really interactive, the player doesn't have any influence on what happens in the game. 
                    
                    In level 4 you'll learn the `if` command, that allows you to give different responses in your program. This way you can program a secret password for your computer for example. 
                    So let's take a peak at level 4. 
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Now you've reached the end of level 4, so you have learned `ask` and `if`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    Level 5 makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in level 6 is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself in the next level!

                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"

                    Great job! You've reached the end of level 5, which means you have practiced with `if` and `else`. You have probably noticed that your codes are getting longer and longer.
                    For example if you want to program 'Happy Birthday'

                    ```
                    print 'happy birthday to you'
                    print 'happy birthday to you'
                    print 'happy birthday dear Hedy'
                    print 'happy birthday to you'

                    ```
                    That's a lot of code for mainly the same words over and over again. Luckily level 6 has a solution with the `repeat` command, that allows you to repeat a line of code multiple times.


                start_code: "print 'On to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    In level 6 you've learned how to repeat one single line of code. This comes in handy, but it's not always enough. Sometimes you want to repeat multiple lines at once.
                    Level 7 allows you to group a couple of lines of code, and repeat that little group of lines all at once!

                    ```
                    repeat 5 times print 'In level 7 you can repeat multiple lines of code at once!'
                    ```

                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?  
                    You have reached the end of level 7, you're doing great! You are about to go to level 8. In the higher levels, Hedy is focussing more and more on teaching you the programming language Python. 
                    In Python there is no `repeat` command, but there is a command that works like repeat. Are you curious to find out how to say `repeat` in "real" programming language? Quickly go to level 8 to find out!
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"

                    ## What's next?
                    Your code is looking more and more like a python code, great! In level 9 you will learn another small step to make it even more like python. 
                    Another great thing you'll learn in level 9 is a new command. In level 8, you might have noticed that you sometimes could use another `else` in your code. 
                    For example: 
                    ```
                    print 'What is for dinner tonight?'
                    options is pizza, broccoli, green beans
                    chosen is options at random
                    if options is pizza
                        print 'Yummy! Pizza!'
                    else
                        print 'Yikes...'
                    ```
                    In this code it would be great to have 2x an `else` so you could have one option for the broccoli and one for the green beans. Level 9 comes with the new command `elif` that makes this possible!
                    So check out the next level now! 
                start_code: "print 'Lets go to the next level!'"
