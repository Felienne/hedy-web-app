In the next tab you'll learn how to use variables with the `{ask}` command to make your game interactive!\n"

                story_text_2: "Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!\nIn level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.\n\nUse 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.\n\n### Exercise\nCan you make a figure with this code? Maybe a triangle or a circle?\n"
