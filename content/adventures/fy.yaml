                story_text: |
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character in your story will be.
                    After that first line, start with `{print}` {if} the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` {if} you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                story_text_2: |
                    The command `{add}` can also come in handy in your story. For example
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} '💥ZAP!💥'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!🦖'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {print} 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```
            12:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```
            13:
                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sword = 'lost'
                    game = 'on'
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 0 {to} 2
                        {if} game {is} 'on'
                            path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'Our hero comes across a dragon!'
                                {print} 'Luckily our hero has a sword to defeat the beast!'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a dragon, but she doesnt have any weapons!'
                                {print} 'Our hero is beaten by the dragon...'
                                {print} 'Try again'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'You have already found the sword. There is nothing left here.'
                                {print} 'She walks back'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a sword'
                                {print} 'This could come in very handy'
                                sword = 'found'
                    ```

                    {print} 'Where do you want to look for them?'
                    {print} 'You can choose: tree, flowerbed, rock, postbox'

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.

                    ### Exercise
                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender
                    Here are all the days of November
                    November 1
                    November 2
                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Wolkom by Hedy! Kinst de kommando's `print`, `ask` en `echo` brûke.

                    Yn de linker balke sjochst alle kommando's dytst brûke kinst yn level 1.

                    Atst op de blauwe knop drukst, wurdt de koade alfêst foar dy ynfolle!

                    Besykje de koade sels te draaien mei de griene 'Koade draaie'-knop ûnder it linker programmearfjild.

                    Witst net watst meitsje silst? Yn de oare tabs stean wat ideeën.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hallo wrâld!

                    ```
                    bisten is hûn, kat, kangeroe
                    print bisten at random
                    ```

                    Yn level 4 binne `ask` en `print` feroare.

                    Tekst dytst letterlik printe wolst, moatst no tusken oanhellingstekens sette.

                    Dat is wol sa handich, want no kinst alle wurden printe dytst mar wolst. Ek de wurden dytst brûkt hast om eat mei te ûnthalden mei `is`.

                    De measte programmeartalen brûke ek oanhellingstekens by it printen, dat sa komme we al in stap tichterby echt programmearje!

                    De kommando's stean wer links, en de opjeften in de oare tabkes. De opjeften wurde stadichoan dreger. Begjin dus links mei it ferhaal, en wurkje sa troch om mear en mear útdage te wurden.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    print 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'
                    answer is ask 'What do we need to use from now on?'
                    print 'We need to use ' answer
                    ```

                    `ask` en `print` wurkje noch lykas yn level 4.

                    Yn level 5 is der wat nijs, de `if`! If is Ingelsk foar 'as'. Mei de `if` kinst in kar (keus) meitsje tusken twa ferskillende opsjes.

                    ```
                    namme is ask 'Wat is dyn namme?'
                    if namme is Hedy print 'leuk' else print 'minder leuk!'
                    ```

                    Dizze koade print 'leuk' ast Hedy als namme ynfolst, en 'minder leuk' ast wat oars ynfolst.

                    Koade mei in `if` kin tige lang wurde en dan past it net mear goed yn it tekstfakje. Brûk yn dat gefal in 'enter' om de koade oer twa rigels te ferdielen. Begjin dan de twadde rigel mei in `else`:
                    ```
                    namme is ask 'Wat is dyn namme?'
                    if namme is Hedy print 'leuk'
                    else print 'minder leuk!'
                    ```


                    Ek yn level 5 wurde de opjeften yn de tabkes stadichoan wat dreger. Doch se dus fan links nei rjochts.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'what is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy {print} 'nice' {else} {print} 'boo!'

                    Mar yn Level 5 is der wat nijs, kinst no ek rekkenje.

                    De plus is maklik, dy skriuwst as by rekkenjen: `5 + 5` bygelyks. De min giet krekt sa, dat is `5 - 5`.

                    Dêrom dogge we de kear mei it stjêrke boppe de 8: `5 * 5`. Lês dat mar as "5 kear 5", dan ûnthâldst it it maklikst.
                    ```
                    print '5 plus 5 is ' 5 + 5
                    print '5 min 5 is ' 5 - 5
                    print '5 kear 5 is ' 5 * 5

                    {print} '5 minus 5 is ' 5 - 5

                    `for` mag meerdere regels gebruiken, net zoals de `repeat` and `if`, dus alle regels eronder moeten met spaties beginnen.

                    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that cmputers use the . for decimal numbers.

                    For this level on you will also have to use quotation marks when storing a text with `is`:

                    ```
                    name = 'Hedy'
                    print 'Hello ' name
                    ```

                    For numbers, you do not use quotation marks in the `is`:
                    ```
                    score = 25
                    print 'You got ' score

                    But maybe you want to recreate a die from a completely different game. That's fine too! Then make up your own reaction. Eg 'yes' for 6 and 'pity' for something {else}.

                    You may know that the worm counts 5 points for Earthworms. Now after a roll you can immediately calculate how many points you have thrown.
                    This is the code to calculate points for one die:

                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?

                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I’m Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...

                    {print} answers {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercises
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    In this level you can use math in your predictions as a fortune teller. This allows you to make up (silly) formulas to calculate the future.

                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'I am Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I can predict how many kids youll get when you grow up!'
                    age = {ask} 'How old are you?'
                    siblings = {ask} 'How many siblings do you have?'
                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'
                    {sleep}
                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'I will predict how smart you are!'
                    football = {ask} 'On a scale 1-10 how much do you love football?'
                    bananas = {ask} 'How many bananas did you eat this week?'
                    hygiene = {ask} 'How many times did you wash your hands today?'
                    result = bananas + hygiene
                    result = result * football
                    {print} 'You are ' result ' percent smart.'
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the `{repeat}` command to make your machine tell multiple fortunes at once.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the fortune teller!'
                    {print} 'You can {ask} 3 questions!'
                    {repeat} 3 {times} question = {ask} 'What do you want to know?'
                    answer = yes, no, maybe
                    {repeat} 3 {times} {print} 'My crystal ball says... ' answer {at} {random}
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    As you can see, the questions aren't printed in this example. That's because the variable `question` was changed 3 times.
                    Every time the player fills in the new answer, Hedy overwrites the previous one, so the first answer the player gave is forgotten.
                    This means you can't print all the questions this way.

                    By using 3 different variables instead of 1 (for example `question1` , `question2` and `question3`), you could solve the problem and print the questions.
                    This does mean that you can only use `{repeat}` for the answers, and you will have to ask and print all the questions separately.
                    Can you do it?

                    In the upcoming levels the layout of {repeat} command will change, which enables you to repeat multiple lines at once.

                    In the next example you can have your fortune teller {ask} 3 questions and also print them!

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?

                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    new_price = _ calculate_new_price {with} old_price, _

                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    We use square brackets to point out a place in a list. For example: `friends[1]` is the first name on the list of friends, as you can see in the first part of the example code. The second part of the example code shows you that we can also match 2 lists using the variable i.

                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    In level 1 you can also use Hedy to draw. By combining turns and lines, you can make a square or a stair!

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} right` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} left` turns counter clockwise.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
