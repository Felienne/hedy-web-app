                    In a previous level you've created a calculator, in this level you can expand that code so it asks multiple questions.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Give the player feedback when the enter an answer, like `{print} 'Correct!'` or `{print} 'Wrong! The correct answer is ' correct_answer`.

                    In the previous level you have practiced with `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    In the previous level you have practiced with `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    This level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in this level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.
                    Go see for yourself!

                    Great job! You've reached another new level! In the previous level you've learned to use multiple lines of code in an {if} or {repeat} command. But you can't yet combine the two...
                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ```

                    Now we are going to change indentation a little bit. Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.

                    In this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for `{else} {if}` and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?

                    Then, use the `{clear}` command to only show one line at a time in your output screen.

                    ### Exercise 2
