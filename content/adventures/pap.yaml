                    Using the `{while}` loop can make your stories more interesting. For example, you can use `{while} game == 'on'` so you can play until the game is over.
                    Or you can use `{while} sword == 'lost'` so the player can't continu the game until they have found something.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Give the player feedback when the enter an answer, like `{print} 'Correct!'` or `{print} 'Wrong! The correct answer is ' correct_answer`.

                    In this adventure you will build a calculator that calculates your mean grade for you. If you get your calculator to work, you can move on to the next adventure, which allows you to add two extra features.

                    ## Exercise 1
                    Fill in the blanks to get the calculator to work.
                    * Start with the fourth line, add a question to figure out what grade the student got.
                    * In the fifth line you'll want to calculate the total of all grades, so the total = total + grade.
                    * Then we get to set the return value. We want to return the mean, so the total devided by the amount of tests (4).
                    * Lastly we finish the code by calling the function in line 8.

                    Did you get it? Awesome! Would you like to add even more to your calculator? **This adventure continues in the next tab!**
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_mean_grade
                        total = 0
                        {for} i {in} {range} 1 {to} 4
                            grade = {ask} _
                            total = total + _
                            return _ / 4

                    mean_grade = {call} _
                    {print} 'Your mean grade is ' mean_grade
                    ```

                            total = total + _
                            return _ / 4

                    You can add the `{while}` loop to the calculator game you've learned to make in a previous level.
                    This makes sure the player can't continue to the next question if they answer incorrectly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    score = 0

                    ## Exercise 2
                    **This is the second part of this adventure.** The adventure starts in the previous tab.
                    Of course, you don't always want to calculate the mean of 4 tests. You might want to calculate the mean of 10 tests or only 2...
                    We can fix this problem by adding the argument and variable 'amount_of_tests'.
                    * Start a new line on line 3. Set the amount_of_tests argument by asking the student how many tests they have made.
                    * Change the 4 in line 4 to the new argument amount_of_tests.
                    * Lastly, change the 4 in line 6 to amount_of_tests

                    Try out your new program. Does it work?

                    ## Exercise 3
                    Did you want to make your program even better? Great! In the previous program you could only calculate the mean grade of 1 subject, but it would be better if you could calculate the mean grade for all subjects you want!
                    We won't tell you how to do it, but we will give you one tip: Start your code in line 1 with: define calculate_mean_grade with subject.

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Fr√®re Jaques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.

                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    This level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in this level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.

                    Good news! In this level you will be allowed to put an {if} inside an {if}, or inside a {repeat} command. Putting a block of code inside another block of code is called nesting.                     ```

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?

                    In the previous levels you have learned to create functions and use arguments with them. Another great use of a function is to let it calculate something for you.
                    You can give the function a calculation and it will give you the answer of the calculation. This answer is called a **return value**.

                    For example, in this code the function calculate_new_price will calculate the new price of any item. It will give you the new price as a return value.

                    ## Exercise
                    Finish this code. We have already made the variable new_price for you, you only need to set it.
                    You should finish the line of code by calling the function that calculates the new price.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {define} calculate_new_price {with} amount, percentage
                        percentage = percentage / 100

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    ### In the block or not?
                    In this level you have to think carefully which lines of code should be in the block and which shouldn't.
                    For example: If you want to sing the song *the muffin man*. You only want the line with 'the muffin man' to be repeated twice.
                    This means the last line shouldn't start with indentation as it doesn't belong to the block.
                    If you do start the last line with indentation the song will turn out wrong.

                    ## Exercise
                    Each line in the example code starts with a blank. Remove the blanks and try to figure out which line need indentation and which don't to make the muffin man song.

                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.

                    ### Exercise
