                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.

What happens in the story? You can also add a second `{ask}` with different options.\n \n### Exercise 2\nGo back to your saved programs, choose your story program from level 5. Now write a good and a bad ending of at least three lines long each! \n"

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.

                    In a previous level you've created a calculator, in this level you can expand that code so it asks multiple questions.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Give the player feedback when the enter an answer, like `{print} 'Correct!'` or `{print} 'Wrong! The correct answer is ' correct_answer`.

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.

                    In level 3 you can make a list. You can let the computer choose something random from the list. You do that with `{at} {random}`.

                    In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.
                    You must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.
                    This is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.
                    Most programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!

                    In level 5 there is something new, the `{if}`! With the `{if}` you can choose between two different options.
                    This code prints nice if you enter Hedy as a name, and boo! if you enter something else.
                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work like they did in level 4.

                    ```

                    In the previous level you have practiced with `{ask}` and `{if}`. For example you can ask guests what they would like to eat.
                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    This level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in this level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.

                    `{ask}` and `{print}` still work as you know them. But `{if}`, `{else}`, {pressed} and `{repeat}` have changed!
                    You can now group several lines together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.
                example_code: |

                        {print} 'Hello everyone'
                        {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'
                    ```
                    This is how the `{if}` and `{else}` command work now:

                    ```
                    name = {ask} 'What is your name?'
                    {if} name {is} Hedy
                        {print} 'Welcome Hedy'

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.

                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?
            14:

                    ```

                        percentage = percentage / 100
                        discount_amount = amount * percentage
                        return amount - discount_amount

                    old_price = {ask} 'How much is on the price tag?'
                    discount = {ask} 'What percentage is the discount?'

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only {echo} the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the toppings!

                    ### Exercise
                    Add the quotation marks to this code to make it work! Be careful: variables should not be in quotation marks.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your restaurant code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots.

                    In this level the `{if}` command allows you to `{ask}` your customers questions and give different responses to the answers.
                    In the example below, you see that you can `{ask}` the customer `{if}` they want to hear the specials and Hedy can respond accordingly.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Welcome to Restaurant Chez Hedy!'
                    special {is} {ask} 'Would you like to hear our specials today?'

                    drink {is} {ask} 'What would you like to drink with that?'
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'Im sorry, we are out of cola!' {else} {print} 'Great choice!'
                    anything {is} {ask} 'Would you like anything else?'
                    {print} 'Let me repeat your order...'
                    {print} 'One ' food
                    {if} drink {is} cola {print} 'and...' {else} {print} 'One ' drink
                    {if} anything {is} no {print} 'Thats it!' {else} {print} 'One ' anything
                    {print} 'Thank you for your order and enjoy your meal!'

                    In this level you've learned how to use the `{repeat}` command to repeat a line of code a certain amount of times.
                    You can use that in your restaurant to `{ask}` multiple people what they'd like to eat.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you complete the code? Hedy needs to repeat this question as many times as there are people. So if there are 5 people, the question needs to be asked 5 times.
                    **(extra)** Expand your code with more questions, for example about drinks or sauce.

                    In this level you can make the turtle draw a figure.
                    The turtle will travel the distances in the list, one by one, making bigger and bigger steps.
                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
                     **(extra)** can you change the spiral into another shape? Experiment with numbers for the turn!
                    ### Exercise 2
                    The spiral is drawn outwards, make it go inwards?
