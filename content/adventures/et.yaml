                story_text: |
                    In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    As the first line, use this code:

                    ```
                    {ask} who is the star in your story?
                    ```

                    After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {ask} Selle loo peategelane on
                    {print} Peategelane jalutab metsa
                    {echo} Ta kardab natuke,
                    {print} Ta kuuleb hirmsaid h√§√§li igal pool
                    {print} Ta kardab, et selles metsas kummitab
                    ```

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you make your own story in Hedy now by using `{print}` , `{ask}` and `{echo}`?

                    ### Exercise
                    Now it's time to add variables to your own story that you've made in the previous level.
                    Go to 'My programs', look for your level 1 story adventure and copy the code. Paste the code in your input screen in this level.

                    This code won't work in this level, because you have not used variables yet.
                    Change the `{ask}` commands and `{echo}` commands in your code to the correct form that you've learned in this level.

                    **Extra** Add a sleep command to your code to build up tension in your story.
            3:
                example_code_2: |
                    ```
                    {print} He hears a sound
                    animals {is} üêø, ü¶î, ü¶á, ü¶â
                    animal {is} {ask} What do you think it is?
                    {add} animal {to_list} animals
                    {print} it was a animals {at} {random}
                    ```
                story_text_3: |
                    This is an example of the `{remove}` command in your story
            5:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can program different endings, which will make your story even more fun.

                    Think of two endings for your story, for example:

                    - The princess is walking through the forest
                    - She runs into a monster

                    - Happy ending: She takes her sword and the monster quickly runs away
                    - Bad Ending: The monster eats the princess

                    You can also ensure that a name can be entered again. That works just like in the previous levels. You can combine that with an `{if}`, and then you have already made a whole program!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name {is} {ask} 'Who is walking in the forest?'
                    {print} name 'walks through the forest'
                    {print} name 'encounter a monster'
                    end {is} {ask} 'Would you like a good or a bad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} good {print} name 'takes the sword and the monster quickly runs away'
                    {else} {print} 'The monster eats' name
                    ```
            7:
                story_text: |
                    In a story, someone says words several times. For example, when someone calls for help or sings a song.
                    You can put such repetitions in your story, in this level with `{repeat}`.
            8:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use multiple lines in your {if} commands, this way you can upgrade your happy or sad ending!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'OH NO! The T-rex is closing in!'
                    end = {ask} 'Do you want a happy or a sad ending?'
                    {if} end {is} happy
                        {print} 'Just in time Richard jumps back into the time machine!'
                        {print} 'Michael types in the code and...'
                        {print} 'üí•ZAP!üí•'
                        {print} 'They are back in their garage'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Michael yells COME ON RICHARD! RUN FASTER!'
                        {print} 'But Richard is too slow...'
                        {print} 'The T-rex closes in and eats him in one big bite!ü¶ñ'
                    ```
            9:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use nesting to put {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands inside other {if}, {repeat} or {for} commands. This gives you many options and really helps you to make your story interactive.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} 'Robin is walking downtown'
                    location = {ask} 'Is Robin going into a shop, or does she go home?'
                    {if} location {is} shop
                        {print} 'She enters the shop.'
                        {print} 'Robin sees an interesting looking book'
                        book = {ask} 'Does Robin buy the book?'
                        {if} book {is} yes
                            {print} 'Robin buys the book and goes home'
                        {else}
                            {print} 'Robin leaves the shop and goes home'
                    {else}
                        {print} 'Robin goes home'
                    ```
            10:
                story_text: |
                    In this level you can use the {for} command in your story. In this way you could easily program the children's book 'brown bear, brown bear, what do you see'.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    animals = red bird, black sheep, green frog, yellow duck, little child
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'brown bear'
                    {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {for} animal {in} animals
                        {print} 'I see a ' animal ' looking at me'
                        {print} animal
                        {print} animal
                        {print} 'What do you see?'
                    {print} 'I see all the animals looking at me!'
                    ```
            12:
                story_text: In this level you can use the quotation marks to save multiple words in a variable.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    name = 'The Queen of England'
                    {print} name ' was eating a piece of cake, when suddenly...'
                    ```
            13:
                story_text: |
                    By using the `{and}` and `{or}` commands, you can shorten your stories. For example, check out the dragon story.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    sword = 'lost'
                    game = 'on'
                    {print} 'Our hero is walking through the forest'
                    {print} 'The path splits two ways'
                    {for} i {in} {range} 0 {to} 2
                        {if} game {is} 'on'
                            path = {ask} 'Which path should she choose?'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'Our hero comes across a dragon!'
                                {print} 'Luckily our hero has a sword to defeat the beast!'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'left' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a dragon, but she doesnt have any weapons!'
                                {print} 'Our hero is beaten by the dragon...'
                                {print} 'Try again'
                                game = 'over'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'found'
                                {print} 'You have already found the sword. There is nothing left here.'
                                {print} 'She walks back'
                            {if} path {is} 'right' {and} sword {is} 'lost'
                                {print} 'Our hero finds a sword'
                                {print} 'This could come in very handy'
                                sword = 'found'

                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.

                    ## The echo command
                    If you want the computer to repeat the answer, you can use the `{echo}` command. The answer will then be echoed back at the end of the sentence, so in this example after hello.

                    Now that you can calculate, you can also create a program to practice maths calculations. You can make up the calculations yourself, for example:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    correct_answer = 11 * 27
                    answer = {ask} 'How much is 11 times 27?'
                    {if} answer {is} correct_answer {print} 'good job!'
                    {else} {print} 'Wrong! It was ' correct_answer
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    You can also let the computer do random calculations on its own using {random}.
                example_code_2: |

                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2

                    Surprise! This program looks more like an output than a code. And yet, we don't want you to just add `{print}` commands in front of each line.
                    Fix this program to turn it into the nursery rhyme 'Brother John (Fr√®re Jaques)' by using the {repeat} command of course!

                    ### Exercise
                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender
                    Here are all the days of November
                    November 1
                    November 2
                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    What you can't yet do though, is calculate the price for everyone's dinner.

                    This level makes it possible to use addition, subtraction and multiplication in your programs. This way you can calculate the prices in your restaurant, but you could also add a secret code to give your friends and family a discount.
                    Another option in this level is programming your own maths game, for your little brother or sister to practice their multiplications.

                    You can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.
                    That means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.

                    In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.
                    `{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces.

                    So far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers.

If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct.
                example_code: |

                    We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.
                    The `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example `age < 12` checks if `age` {is} smaller than 12.
                    If you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example `age <= 11`.
                    The `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example `points > 10` checks if `points` is larger than 10.
                    If you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example `points >= 11`.
                    You use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:

                    We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.
                    So don't forget to change the value in the loop.

                    In the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.
                    If the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!

                    This time the sample code is not quite complete.

                    Can you complete the code by filling the blanks? Every blank must be replaced with one word of symbol.

                    Tip: Don't forget the quotation marks!

                    With the `{if}` you can now have more fun with choice in the program. You can have your program respond to the choice that the computer has made.

                    Can you finish the code so that it prints 'too bad' when it is your turn and otherwise 'yes!'?
                    Don't forget the quotes!

                    If you are extremely unlucky the previous program might choose you to to the dishes for the whole week! That's not fair!
                    To create a fairer system you can use the `{remove}` command to remove the chosen person from the list. This way you don't have to do the dishes again untill everybody has had a turn.

                    Monday and tuesday are ready for you! Can you add the rest of the week?
                    And... can you come up with a solution for when your list is empty?

                    In this level, we add a new form of the `{for}`. In earlier levels, we used `{for}` with a list, but we can also use `{for}` with numbers.
                    We do that by adding a variable name, followed by  `{in}` `{range}`. We then write the number to start at, `{to}` and the number to end at.
                    Try the example to see what happens! In this level again, you will need to use indentations in lines below the `{for}` statements.

                    Have you ever been to a carnival and had your future predicted by a fortune teller? Or have you ever played with a magic eight ball?
                    Then you probably know that they can't really predict your future, but it's still fun to play!

                    In the upcoming levels you can learn how to create your own fortune telling machine!
                    In level 1 you can start off easy by letting Hedy introduce herself as a fortune teller and let her {echo} the players' answers.
                    Like this:
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Hello, I'm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    {ask} Who are you?
                    {print} Let me take a look in my crystal ball
                    {print} I see... I see...
                    {echo} Your name is
                    ```
                story_text_2: |
                    ### Exercise
                    Hedy now only tells you your name. Can you expand the code so that Hedy can predict more things about you?
                    Obviously, Hedy isn't a very good fortune teller yet, as she can only repeat the answers that were given by the players!
                    Take a look in level 2 to improve your fortune teller.

                    In the previous levels you've created your first fortune telling machine, but Hedy couldn't really predict anything, only {echo}.
                    In this level you can use a variable and the `{at} {random}` command to really let Hedy choose an answer for you. Check out this code for instance:
                example_code: |
                    In this example the player can {ask} Hedy a yes-no question and Hedy will pick a random answer for you.
                    ```
                    {print} I‚Äôm Hedy the fortune teller!
                    question {is} {ask} What do you want to know?
                    {print} This is what you want to know: question
                    answers {is} yes, no, maybe
                    {print} My crystal ball says...
                    {sleep} 2
                    {print} answers {at} {random}

                    ### Exercises
                    Now, Hedy can only answer yes, no or maybe. Can you give Hedy more answer options, like 'definitely' or '{ask} again'.

                    For example you could calculate how rich you'll get or how many kids you will have when you grow up.

                    length = {ask} 'How tall are you in centimetres?'
                    kids = length / age
                    kids = kids - siblings
                    {print} 'You will get ...'

                    {print} kids ' kids!'
                    ```

                    If the previous example wasn't silly enough for you, take a look at this one!

                    ```
                    {print} 'Im Hedy the silly fortune teller!'

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?

                        discount_amount = amount * percentage

                    Up until this level the haunted house game always asked the player to choose a door, but as you might have noticed, they didn't really have to answer correctly.
                    If the player filled in a completely random answer, the game would still work and the player might even win (despite not picking a door).
                    In this level you can only win the game by picking the same door Hedy picked randomly.

                    Another interesting thing you can so with the `{repeat}` command is using variables to set the amount of times something should be repeated. In the example code you can see that we first ask the person how old they are.
                    Then, in line 3, the question is repeated 'age' times. So we have used the variable 'age' with the `{repeat}` command.

                    ### Exercise
                    Can you think of more lines to add to your restaurant code? For example, can you {ask} the guests what they'd like to drink, tell them the price, or wish them a pleasant meal?

                    In level 2 you could expand your restaurant by using variables. In level 1 Hedy could only {echo} the order once and only remember the last thing that was ordered.
                    Now you can use variables and Hedy can remember both the food and the drinks!
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {print} Welcome to Hedy's restaurant!
                    {print} Today we're serving pizza or lasagna.
                    food {is} {ask} What would you like to eat?
                    {print} Great choice! The food is my favorite!
                    topping {is} {ask} Would you like meat or veggies on that?
                    {print} food with topping is on its way!
                    drinks {is} {ask} What would you like to drink with that?
                    {print} Thank you for your order.

                    {print} And as dessert: desserts {at} {random}
                    {print} You will get a drinks {at} {random} to drink
                    {print} That will be: prices {at} {random}

                    Add the quotation marks to this code to make it work! Be careful: variables should not be in quotation marks.
                    Then, use the `{clear}` command to only show one line at a time in your output screen.

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Go back to the previous level and copy your restaurant code. Make the code work in this level by adding quotation marks in the right spots and add some `{clear}` commands.

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. Sometimes the repetition is also based on counting.
                    For example, in the well-known song 'Bottles of beer'. You can program that song with a little math.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    verse = 99
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer'
                    {print} 'Take one down, pass it around'
                    verse = verse - 1
                    {print} verse ' bottles of beer on the wall'
                    ```

                    You can now repeat lines 2 to 9 as many times as you want by copying the lines.

                    Songs often contain a lot of repetition. For example... Baby Shark! If you sing it, you keep singing the same thing:

                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark tututudutudu <br>
                    Baby Shark

                    You can make this song much shorter with a `{repeat}`! Can you finish the code?
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    {repeat} _ _ {print} 'Baby Shark tututudutudu'
                    {print} 'Baby Shark'
                    ```

                    After Baby Shark you can of course also program other songs. There are many songs with repetition.

                    Using `{forward}` you draw a line forwards. The number behind it determines how far the turtle will walk. `{turn} {right}` turns a quarter turn in clockwise direction, `{turn} {left}` turns counter clockwise.
                    If you want to go backwards, you use the `{forward}` command but with a negative number. So for example `{forward} -100`

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Add a 90 degree turn in the loop, so that a spiral is drawn.
                    Add at least 5 numbers to the list, so the spiral grows larger.
