                    ## Add to
                    You can add items to the list with the `{add} {to_list}` command. To add an item to a list you can simply type: `{add} penguin {to} animals` or you can use the `{ask}` command like in the example code.

                    In a previous level you've created a calculator, in this level you can expand that code so it asks multiple questions.

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Can you finish line 10 to get the code to work?

                    ### Exercise 2
                    Give the player feedback when the enter an answer, like `{print} 'Correct!'` or `{print} 'Wrong! The correct answer is ' correct_answer`.

                    ### Exercise
                    Debug this calender program. The output of this program is supposed to look like a list of dates.
                    For example:

                    ```
                    Hedy calender
                    Here are all the days of November
                    November 1
                    November 2
                    November 3
                    ```
                    And so on.

                    Mind that you have to test your code extra carefully for the month February, because the amount of days in this month changes in leap years.

                    Now that you've learned how to use functions, you'll learn how to use a function with an argument.
                    An **argument** is a variable that is used within a function. It is not used outside the function.

                    For example in this code we've programmed the first verse of the song 'My Bonnie is over the ocean'.
                    In this example code the argument `place` is used. Place is a variable that is only used in the function, so an argument.
                    To use `place` we have programmed the line `define song with place`.
                    When the function is called, computer will replace the argument `place`, with the piece of text after `call song with`.

                    ### Exercise
                    The next verse of this song goes:

                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    Last night as I lay on my bed
                    Last night as I lay on my pillow
                    I dreamed that my Bonnie is dead

                    Can you program this verse in the same way as the example?

                        discount_amount = amount * percentage

                    ### Exercise 1
                    Complete the code by filling the right command on the blank. Tip: The superspy has to answer BOTH questions correctly, before they get the confidential information!

                    ### Exercise 2
                    We want confuse the enemy even more! Create a list with fake answers and select one at random when a wrong answer is given.

                    In this level you can use variables to make the turtle interactive. For example you can ask the player how many steps the turtle must make.
                example_code: |
                    ```
                    answer {is} {ask} How many steps should the turtle make?
                    {forward} answer
                    ```

                    Also, in level 1 the turtle could only turn left or right. That is a bit boring!
                    In level 2 he can point his nose in all directions.

                    Use 90 to turn a quarter. We call this degrees. A full turn is 360 degrees.
