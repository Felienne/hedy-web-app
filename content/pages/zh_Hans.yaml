    -   title: 海迪（Hedy）是什么？
        text: "Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).\nIn contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn't use code blocks but textual code.\nSo with Hedy you'll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises.\nThis way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way!\nHere you can watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) about the development of Hedy as a programming language.\n"
    -   title: Target audience
        text: "Hedy's developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15).\nIt's important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level.\nStudents (and teachers!) don't need any programming experience before starting with Hedy.\n"

    -   title: Teaching with Hedy
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands.\nThe exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.\nThe lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises!\n"
    -   title: Devices
        text: "Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!\n"

    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My profile' and 'My profile' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n"
    -   title: Storing programs
        text: "Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.\nThese tabs exist for you students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that have been saved.\n\nYou can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.\n\nLet the programming fun begin!\n"

    title: Teaching with Hedy
    subsections:
    -   text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
        title: ' '
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Quiz
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   title: Evaluation
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.\n"
                solution_code: "print Hedy can print this!\n"
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"
                solution_text: "Remove the capitals.\n"
                solution_code: "ask Why does my code work now?\nprint Because I removed the capitals!\n"
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is\n"
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"
                solution_text: "In level 1 we have to keep it at this:\n"
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is...\n"
        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"
                solution_code: "forward -100\n"
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "backward 100\n"
            title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doens't exist"
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: Students make typos in their commands
            example:
                error_text: "Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.\n"
                error_code: "prinnt Don't make typos!\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
                solution_code: "print Don't make typos!\n"
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
                solution_code: "order is What would you like to eat?\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command. '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                error_text: "A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.\n"
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries\n"
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text.
            example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animal at random\n"
                solution_text: "Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animals at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_text: "Like in the example\n"
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_text: "This problem is solved by adding the word at.\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command.
            example:
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_text: "After each item on your list, there should be a comma\n"
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list.
            example:
                error_text: "For example\n"
                error_code: "clubs is Manchester United\nprint clubs at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.\n"
                solution_code: "clubs is Manchester United, Bayrn Munchen, FC Barcelona\nprint clubs at random\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use add/remove without a list '
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.\n"
                error_code: "names is Jake\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
                solution_text: "There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.\n"
                solution_code: "names is Jake, Amy\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
        -   example:
                error_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice\nremove dice\nprint I love adventures at random\n"
                error_text: "Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.\n"
                solution_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice to adventures\nremove dice from adventures\nprint I love adventures at random\n"

    -   level: '4'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text
            example:
                error_text: "In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.\n"
                error_code: "print Hello\nmood is ask 'How are you?\n"
                solution_text: "Add the correct quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Hello'\nmood is ask 'How are you?'\n"
        -   title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: "It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the \"double quotes\" or the `skewed one`.\n"
                error_code: "print `Welcome to the restaurant`\nfood is ask \"What would you like to order?\"\n"
                solution_text: "These are the correct quotation marks:\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Welcome to the restaurant'\nfood is ask 'What would you like to order?'\n"
        -   title: Students use an apostrophe in their text
            example:
                error_text: "From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when thyping contractions like you're, don't or what's.\n"
                error_code: "print 'You're not allowed to type this'\n"
                solution_text: "You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Youre allowed to type this'\nprint 'And you`re able to do this'\n"
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use print in an if command
            example:
                error_text: "After students use if or else they forget to use a second command like print or ask.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Hedy 'Great!'\nelse 'Hedy is better!'\n"
                solution_text: "Add the print command to fix it.\n"
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'Great!'\nelse print 'Hedy is better!'\n"
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask 'What is your horse called?'\nif name is Bonfire print 'cool'\nelse print 'less cool!'\n"

                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'\n"
        -   title: Students use quotes around variable names.
            example:
                error_text: "In this level there are no quotes around variable names.\n"
                error_code: "if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'\nelse print 'meh!'\n"

                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask 'which door do you pick?'\n"
        -   title: Students want multiple answers to be correct
            example:
                error_text: "For example this student Hedy to tell all his friends that they are funny, but other classmates would be told that they are not.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'\n"
                solution_text: "You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.\nAnother solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.\n"
                solution_code: "friends is Jesse, David, Souf\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif name in friends print 'You are funny'\nelse print 'You are not funny'\n\nor\n\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif naam is Jesse print 'You are funny'\nif naam is David print 'You are funny'\nif naam is Souf print 'You are funny'\n"
        -   title: The students make the variable name the same as the value in the if statement
            example:
                error_text: "In the example below the password is 'password'. This will result in it always being correct.\n"
                error_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is password print 'Access granted'\nelse print 'Acces denied!'\n"

    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

    text: |
        学习编程是一件很难的事情。不是说编程本身很难! 而是你需要记住很多规则，就像你刚刚开始学习英语时一样。
        同样的，你也需要通过做大量练习题来学习编程。

        当然你现在可以轻松地读懂这段话。但你还记得你小时候是怎么学习阅读的吗？你那时候学习每个字都需要花费一定的时间!
        对于编程来说也是如此，刚刚开始学的时候可能会觉得很难，但以后会变得越来越容易!

        Hedy（海迪）最大的好处就是你可以*循序渐进*的学习编程。这意味着你不必一下子学会所有的规则
        最初的几个级别里面没有太多的规则，所以你一开始就可以轻松的学习编程。
        在每一个级别里面我们都会增加新的规则，增加你所知道的命令数量。命令是计算机的指令。

-   title: "谁适合学习Hedy（海迪）？"
    text: |
        Hedy（海迪）是为所有想学习编程的孩子们设计的! 当然你要有一定的英语基础。
-   title: "我需要有编程经验吗？"
    text: |
        不，这不需要。不过，如果你曾经用Scratch或Python编写过程序，你会觉得有些命令很熟悉
-   title: "Hedy（海迪）是免费的吗？"
    text: |
        是的！莱顿大学允许我们免费分享它。Hedy（海迪） 也是 "开源 "的，这意味着每个会编程的人都可以帮助我们把 Hedy（海迪） 做得更好。
        你可以在 GitHub上找到它的代码，[GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).
        如果你喜欢Hedy并想要捐助这个项目，我们愿意接受您的捐助（并非常感谢） [捐款](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy)!
