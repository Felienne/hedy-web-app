        text: "Hedy on tekstipõhine programmeerimiskeel, mis on spetsiaalselt välja töötatud (eel)teismelistele (10-15 aastastele).\nErinevalt lastele mõeldud programmeerimiskeeltest, nagu Scratch, ei kasuta Hedy koodiplokke, vaid tekstilist koodi.\nNii et Hedyga õpid sa koodi kirjutama nagu tõelised programmeerijad, kuid väikeste sammude ja mänguliste harjutuste abil.\nNii saab Hedy toimida vaheastena tõeliste programmeerimiskeelte, nagu Python, õppimisel ning teha seda ligipääsetaval ja mis veel tähtsam, lõbusal viisil!\nSiit saate vaadata (inglisekeelset) [videot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) Hedy arendamisest.\n"
    -   title: Sihtrühm
        text: "Hedy on välja töötatud põhikooli õpilasi silmas pidades (vanuses 10 - 15).\nOluline on, et õpilased oskaksid hästi lugeda. Me ei soovita alustada Hedyga enne, kui õpilastel on vähemalt kolmanda klassi lugemisoskus.\nEi õpilastel ega õpetajatel ei ole vaja varasemat programmeerimisoskust.\n"

    -   title: Õpetamine Hedyga
        text: "Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught. Each level contains a variety of adventures to practice the newly learned commands.\nAs a teacher, you get to decide which adventures are available for your students. Will they be making a restaurant, a calculator or a haunted house this level? Within each level, the adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest.\nSo your students keep getting challenged. The adventures can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in a classical instruction.\n\nThe adventures also include a code example, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers are able to use Hedy too!\nOf course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and adventures!\n\nAfter programming all the adventures of a certain level, your students can test their knowledge in the quiz.\nYou can track your students' work and their progress on the class page.\n"
    -   title: Devices
        text: "Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy.\nThere's no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you're all set!\n"

    -   title: Creating a Class
        text: "As a teacher, you can create a class for your students. In this class you can see the students' accounts and their programs and you could monitor their progress.\nYou can also customize your class and choose which adventures are available for them. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.\n"
    -   title: Student Accounts
        text: "There are 2 ways to let your students join your class: You can let them make their own accounts or you can create accounts for them.\n\n**Students make their own accounts**\nYour students can go to the Hedy website and create their own accounts, just like you did. To get them into your class, they simply have to click the invite link.\nYou can find the invite link on the class page and send it to your students. Mind that your students have to be logged in to Hedy when they click the link, so make ot work smoothly.\n\n**You create accounts for your students**\nSometimes it's easier to create a whole bunch of accounts for your students yourself. This can be done by clicking the 'create student accounts' button and filling in usernames and passwords for them.\nThe students can login with the username and password that you chose. Afterwards, they can change their username or password if they'd like and they'll still remain in your class.\n"
    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n\n**For non-English speakers**\nNot only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\n"
    -   title: Storing programs
        text: "Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.\nThese tabs exist for your students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that you've saved.\n\nYou can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.\nYou (and your students) can also share programs. These programs will be posted on our explore page, for everybody to see and use.\nIf you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.\n"

    -   title: Teaching with Hedy
        text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Quiz
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   title: Evaluation
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"
-   title: Frequently made mistakes
    levels:
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: "For example they type a sentence without using print.\n"
                error_code: "Hedy can't print this\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.\n"
                solution_code: "print Hedy can print this!\n"
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: "Commands won't work if they are in capitals.\n"
                error_code: "Ask Why does my code fail?\nPrint Because I'm using capitals.\n"
                solution_text: "Remove the capitals.\n"
                solution_code: "ask Why does my code work now?\nprint Because I removed the capitals!\n"
        -   example:
                solution_text: "Add an ask command to make it work.\n"
                solution_code: "ask What's your name?\necho Your name is\n"
                error_text: "Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.\n"
                error_code: "echo Your name is\n"
            title: Students use echo without ask
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: "And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.\n"
                error_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho is the best!\n"
                solution_text: "In level 1 we have to keep it at this:\n"
                solution_code: "ask Which programming language is the most fun?\necho The best is...\n"
        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: "Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.\n"
                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"
                solution_code: "forward 100\nturn 90\n"
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doesn't exist"
            example:
                error_text: "Backward is not a command.\n"
                error_code: "backward 100\n"
                solution_text: "To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:\n"
                solution_code: "forward -100\n"
        level: '1'
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students make typos in their commands
            example:
                error_text: "Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.\n"
                error_code: "prinnt Don't make typos!\n"
                solution_text: "Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.\n"
                solution_code: "print Don't make typos!\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.\n"
                error_code: "ask what would you like to eat?\n"
                solution_text: "In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.\n"
                solution_code: "order is What would you like to eat?\n"
            title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command. '
            example:
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"
                error_code: "answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!\necho\n"
                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                solution_code: "answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!\nprint answer\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n"
                solution_text: "So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n"
            title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
        -   example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"
                error_code: "chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?\n"
                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?\n"
            title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
        -   example:
                error_text: "In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.\n"
                error_code: "horse is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
                solution_text: "Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.\n"
                solution_code: "name is ask What is your horse called?\nprint Your horse is called name\n"
            title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
        level: '2'
    -   level: '3'
        sections:
        -   title: Students try to print whole lists
            example:
                error_text: "A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.\n"
                error_code: "groceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries\n"
                solution_text: "To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.\n"
                solution_code: "print apples, milk, chocolate\n\nor\n\ngroceries is apples, milk, chocolate\nprint groceries at random\n"
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text.
            example:
                error_text: "This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.\n"
                error_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi my name is name\n\nor\n\nanimal is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animal at random\n"
                solution_text: "Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "name is Hedy\nprint Hi I'm name\n\nor\n\nanimals is rhino, bee, swan\nprint The best animal is... animals at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget at in at random
            example:
                error_text: "Like in the example\n"
                error_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds random\n"
                solution_text: "This problem is solved by adding the word at.\n"
                solution_code: "birds is sparrow, seagull, robin\nprint birds at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command.
            example:
                error_text: "Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.\n"
                error_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nfruit at random\n"
                solution_text: "Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.\n"
                solution_code: "fruit is apple, cherry, banana\nprint fruit at random\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: "In a list items are seperated with a comma.\n"
                error_code: "pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
                solution_text: "After each item on your list, there should be a comma\n"
                solution_code: "pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni\nprint pizzas at random\n"
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list.
            example:
                error_text: "For example\n"
                error_code: "clubs is Manchester United\nprint clubs at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.\n"
                solution_code: "clubs is Manchester United, Bayrn Munchen, FC Barcelona\nprint clubs at random\n"
        -   title: 'Students try to use add/remove without a list '
            example:
                solution_code: "names is Jake, Amy\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
                error_text: "In the example below 'names' is not a list, but a variable. You cannot add anything to it.\n"
                error_code: "names is Jake\nyour_name is ask Who are you?\nadd your_name to names\nprint names at random\n"
                solution_text: "There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.\n"
        -   title: Students forget to use to/from in add/remove.
            example:
                error_text: "Without to/from the add/remove command won't work.\n"
                error_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice\nremove dice\nprint I love adventures at random\n"
                solution_text: "Hedy has to know which list the item should be added to/removed from.\n"
                solution_code: "adventures is story, parrot, dice\nchoice is Which adventure do you like best?\nadd choice to adventures\nremove dice from adventures\nprint I love adventures at random\n"
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use quotation marks on both sides of the text
            example:
                error_text: "In this level print and ask need a set of quotation marks. One before of the text and one after.\n"
                error_code: "print Hello\nmood is ask 'How are you?\n"
                solution_text: "Add the correct quotation marks.\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Hello'\nmood is ask 'How are you?'\n"
        -   title: Students use the wrong quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: "It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the \"double quotes\" or the `skewed one`.\n"
                error_code: "print `Welcome to the restaurant`\nfood is ask \"What would you like to order?\"\n"
                solution_text: "These are the correct quotation marks:\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Welcome to the restaurant'\nfood is ask 'What would you like to order?'\n"

                error_text: "From this level on apostrophes are not allowed. They are often used in English when thyping contractions like you're, don't or what's.\n"
                solution_text: "You can choose to use the wrong grammar and just leave the apostrophe out. Or you could use the ` as an apostrophe.\n"
                solution_code: "print 'Youre allowed to type this'\nprint 'And you`re able to do this'\n"
        level: '4'
    -   sections:
        -   title: Students forget to use print in an if command
            example:
                error_text: "After students use if or else they forget to use a second command like print or ask.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Hedy 'Great!'\nelse 'Hedy is better!'\n"
                solution_text: "Add the print command to fix it.\n"
                solution_code: "if name is Hedy print 'Great!'\nelse print 'Hedy is better!'\n"
        -   example:

            title: Students use quotes around variable names.
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: "A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.\n"

                solution_text: "Add an underscore.\n"
                solution_code: "chosen_door is ask 'which door do you pick?'\n"
        -   example:
                error_text: "For example this student Hedy to tell all his friends that they are funny, but other classmates would be told that they are not.\n"
                error_code: "if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'\n"
                solution_text: "You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.\nAnother solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.\n"
                solution_code: "friends is Jesse, David, Souf\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif name in friends print 'You are funny'\nelse print 'You are not funny'\n\nor\n\nname is ask 'Who are you?'\nif naam is Jesse print 'You are funny'\nif naam is David print 'You are funny'\nif naam is Souf print 'You are funny'\n"
            title: Students want multiple answers to be correct
        -   example:
                error_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is password print 'Access granted'\nelse print 'Acces denied!'\n"
                solution_text: "Pick a different name for your variable.\n"
                solution_code: "secret_password is ask 'What is the password'\nif secret_password is password print 'Access granted!'\nelse print 'Access denied!'\n"
                error_text: "In the example below the password is 'password'. This will result in it always being correct.\n"
            title: The students make the variable name the same as the value in the if statement
        level: '5'
    key: common_mistakes
    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

-   title: What is a gradual programming language?
    text: "Learning to program can be hard. Not that programming itself *is* hard! But there are a lot of rules you need to memorize, just like when you started to learn English.\nSimilarly, you will need a lot of practice to learn programming.\n\nYou can read these sentences with ease. But do you remember when you were learning to read? You took some time then for each letter!\nThat is true for programming too, it might be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier!\n\nThe nice thing about Hedy is that Hedy is *gradual*. That means that you do not have to learn all rules at once.\nThe first few levels do not have that many rules, so you can get used to programming comfortably.\nIn every level we add new rules, increasing the number of commands that you know. Commands are instructions for a computer.\n"

    title: Why is Hedy gradual?
-   title: Who is Hedy for?
    text: "Hedy is meant for all kids that want to learn programming! You do need to be able to read English with ease.\n"
-   title: Do I need programming experience?
    text: "No, that is not needed. However, if you have programmed with Scratch or Python, some commands will look familiar to you.\n"
-   title: Is Hedy free?
    text: "Yes! Leiden University allows us to share it for free. Hedy is also 'Open source', which means that everyone who can program can help us make Hedy better.\nYou can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Felienne/hedy).\nIf you like Hedy and want to contribute, we do accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://www.steunleiden.nl/project/hedy)!\n"
-   title: Do I need to install anything?
    text: No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on your phone or tablet.
