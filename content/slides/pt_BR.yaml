                Programar é dar instruções para um computador, num idioma especial dele.

                Um idioma desse tipo é chamado de uma "linguagem de programação".

                Talvez você já conheça algumas linguagems de programação?
                Alguns exemplos são:
                * Scratch
                * Python
                * HTML

                Se você pode programar, pode fazer muitas coisas legais:
                * Construir histórias interativas
                * Criar desenhos digitais e desenhá-los no papel ou em tecido
                * Criar seus próprios aplicativos para usar no seu celular

                Vamos começar o nível 1 fazendo uma história em Hedy!

                Nós vamos precisar de três códigos para criar histórias interativas.
        2:
            text: |-
                O primeiro código que você pode usar no nível 1 é `{print}`.

                `{print}` é usado para mostrar texto na tela.
            code: '{print} Mostrar texto na tela'

                Você pode mudar o texto depois do comando de imprimir para o que você quiser.

                Ou você pode imprimir várias linhas adicionando outra linha de código que também começa com `{print}`.
            code: |-
                {print} Bem-vindo(a) à Hedy!
                {print} Comece agora a programar!

                O segundo código que você pode usar no nível 1 é `{ask}`.

                `{ask}` é usado para fazer uma pergunta que pode ser respondida.
            code: |-
                {print} Bem-vindo(a) a seu próprio jogo de pedra, papel e tesoura!

                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
                This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.
            code: |-

                Neste nível, você irá aprender a usar variáveis.

                Uma variável é uma palavra que pode ser usada para guardar uma informação.

                Por exemplo: um nome, uma idade ou um time favorito.
        2:
            header: Variáveis
            text: Para criar ou 'definir' uma variável, usamos o comando `{is}`
            code: |-

                idade {is} 15
                {print} nome tem idade anos
        3:
            text: |-
                We can also set a variable by asking questions.

                The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

                This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.
            code: |-
                nome {is} {ask} Qual é o seu nome?
                {print} Olá nome
            header: Interactive
        4:
            header: Múltiplas variáveis
            text: Agora que nós usamos variáveis, podemos usar várias delas ao invés de ter um só comando `{echo}`.
            code: |-
                nome {is} {ask} Qual é o seu nome?
                {print} Olá nome
                idade {is} {ask} Quantos anos você tem?
                {print} nome tem idade anos.
        5:
            header: Durma
            text: You can also use the `{sleep}` command to pause the code for a while.
            code: "{print} My favorite colour is...\n{sleep} 2\n{print} green!"
        6:
            header: Sleep 5
            text: "You can add a number after the `{sleep}` command if you want the pause to be longer.\n\nIf you want, you could even use a variable instead of a number to decide the duration of the sleep command."
