# Working with Weblate

Installing wlc (pip install wlc) gives you some control over the Weblate environment. To use this, create a .weblate file in the root and put the following content in there:

```
[weblate]
url = https://hosted.weblate.org/api/
translation = hedy/level-defaults
key = <personal key>
```

The personal key can be found in your profile on Weblate.
