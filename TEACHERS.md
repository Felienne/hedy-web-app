Teacher functionalities
================

Hedy supports a lot of exciting features specially aimed at teachers to help them teaching Hedy.
As the amount of features keeps growing this document is used as a guideline and overview of all available Teacher features.

Introduction
================
When creating an account users are able to apply for a "Teachers account". These are set manually by Felienne on request.
Another way to achieve a Teachers account is by using the correct `/invite` link. This link is set by Hedy people giving workshop to easily let participants achieve a Teachers account.
For example, when giving a workshop at a specific University we can set it to `/invite/UniversityBlaBla`. When a logged-in user visits this link they are automatically granted Teacher rights.
Teachers have additional functionalities over _normal_ users. All functionality is found on the `/for-teachers` page. We separate them into three majors parts:

- Class management
    - Class creation, customizations and management
    - Class and student statistics
- Adventure creation
    - Create custom adventures, include through class customizations 
- Multiple account creation
    - Enable multiple mail-less account creation
    - Automatic class enrollment

### Class management
Teachers are able to create and manage personal classes. On the `/for-teachers` page there is a section called _My classes_.
A new class with a custom name can be created using the "_Create a class_" button. After class creation you are re-directed to the _Class overview_.
This page has all relevant information for the current class. Divided in students overview tabls and several buttons. Currently the following functionalities are supported:

- Customize class
- Rename class
- Invite students (by username)
    - Alternatively, there is also a _join link_ that can be copied 
- Class statistics

Within the students overview table general information on all students can be found. Such as _last login_, _highest level_ and _amount of programs_.
This table view is customizable with the corresponding header checkboxes at the top of the table. 
Teachers are also able to change the password of one of their students or remove them from the class all together.

When inviting a student the corresponding username should be entered. Accounts are only able to have one pending invite at a time.
When sent the students can find their invite under the _messages_ section, found on the `/my-profile` page.
Invitations have an expiration date of **7 days**.
