                    Om In level 1 you can make a story with a different main character that you enter yourself.

                    Om In the first line, use `{ask}` and ask who the main character of the story will be.

                    Om After that first line, start with `{print}` if the sentence needs to be printed.
                    Om You use `{echo}` if you want your main character to be at the end of the sentence.
